It is bordered to the north by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Tanzania]] to the north-east, [[Malawi]] to the east, [[Mozambique]] to the southeast, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Botswana]] to the south, [[Namibia]] to the southwest, and [[Angola]] to the west. The capital city of Zambia is [[Lusaka]], located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the [[Copperbelt Province]] to the north, the core economic hubs of the country.

Originally inhabited by [[Khoisan]] peoples, the region was affected by the [[Bantu expansion]] of the thirteenth century. Following [[European colonization of Africa|European expeditions]] in the eighteenth century, Britain colonised the region, forming the [[British protectorate]]s of [[Barotziland–North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]]. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the [[British South Africa Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Zambian High Commission|url=https://www.zambiapretoria.net/history/|website=www.zambiapretoria.net|access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref>

On 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom as a republic in [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia |url=https://commonwealthchamber.com/member-countries/zambia/ |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=Commonwealth Chamber of Commerce |language=en-US}}</ref> and prime minister [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the inaugural [[president of Zambia|president]]. Kaunda's [[socialism|socialist]] [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991 with him playing a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.<ref>Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States, and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).</ref> From 1972 to 1991, Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto ""One Zambia, One Nation"" coined by Kaunda. Kaunda was succeeded by [[Frederick Chiluba]] of the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] in 1991, beginning a period of socio-economic development and government decentralisation. Zambia has since become a multi-party state and has experienced several peaceful transitions of power.

==Etymology==

{{further|Rhodesia (name)}}

The territory of Zambia was known as [[Northern Rhodesia]] from 1911 to 1964. It was renamed Zambia in October 1964 on its independence from British rule. The name Zambia derives from the [[Zambezi]] River (Zambezi may mean ""the grand river"").<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Everett-Heath|first1=John|title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT1589|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|date=7 December 2017|isbn=978-0-19-255646-2}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Zambia}}

===Prehistoric era===
Archaeological excavation work on the [[Zambezi Valley]] and [[Kalambo Falls]] shows a succession of human cultures. Ancient camp site tools near the Kalambo Falls have been radiocarbon dated to more than 36,000 years ago.

The fossil skull remains of the [[Homo rhodesiensis|Broken Hill Man]] (also known as Kabwe Man), dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years BC, further shows that the area was inhabited by early humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malcolm Southwood, Bruce Cairncross & Mike S. Rumsey|date=2019|title=Minerals of the Kabwe (""Broken Hill"") Mine, Central Province, Zambia, Rocks & Minerals|journal=Rocks & Minerals|volume=94|issue=2 |pages=114–149|doi=10.1080/00357529.2019.1530038|s2cid=135446729 |issn=0035-7529}}</ref> Broken Hill Man was discovered in Zambia in [[Kabwe District]].

=== Khoisan and Batwa ===
[[File:NsaluCave.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient (but graffitied) Rock Art in Nsalu Cave, Kasanka National Park in North-Central Zambia]]
Modern Zambia once was inhabited by the Khoisan and [[Twa|Batwa]] peoples until around AD 300, when migrating [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] began to settle the areas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Timothy|title=Cultures of the World: Zambia|publisher=Times Books International|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7614-0694-5|location=Tarrytown, New York|pages=19–20}}</ref> It is believed the Khoisan people originated in East Africa and spread southwards around 150,000 years ago. The Twa people were split into two groups: the [[Kafwe Twa]] lived around the [[Kafue Flats]] and the [[Lukanga Twa]] who lived around the [[Lukanga Swamp]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=30 March 2020|title=Twa|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/pre-bantu-invasion/twa/|access-date=27 October 2020|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en|archive-date=7 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107062915/https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/pre-bantu-invasion/twa/|url-status=live}}</ref> Many examples of ancient rock art in Zambia, like the [[Mwela Rock Paintings]], [[Mumbwa Caves]], and Nachikufu Cave, are attributed to these early hunter-gatherers.<ref name=""isygi"">{{cite journal | last=Musonda | first=Francis B. | title=Late Pleistocene and Holocene Microlithic Industries from the Lunsemfwa Basin, Zambia | journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin | publisher=JSTOR | volume=39 | issue=139 | year=1984 | pages=24–36 | issn=0038-1969 | doi=10.2307/3888592 | jstor=3888592 }}</ref> The Khoisan and especially the Twa formed a patron-client relationship with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups.

===The Bantu (Abantu)===
The Bantu people or Abantu (meaning people) are an enormous and diverse ethnolinguistic group that comprise the majority of people in much of eastern, southern and central Africa. Due to Zambia's location at the crossroads of Central Africa, Southern Africa, and the [[African Great Lakes]], the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions.

Many of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously. Thus, Zambia's history, like that of many African nations, cannot be presented perfectly chronologically. The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records, archaeology, and written records, mostly from non-Africans.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Scott D.|title=Culture and Customs of Zambia|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/scott_d._taylor_culture_and_customs_of_zambia_cbook4you.pdf|publisher=Greenwood Press|access-date=25 March 2018|archive-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329102016/http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/scott_d._taylor_culture_and_customs_of_zambia_cbook4you.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

====First Bantu settlement====
The first Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes. They arrived around the first millennium C.E, and among them were the Tonga, [[Ila people|Ila]] and [[Mwanga people|Namwanga]] people and other related groups, who settled around [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]] near Zimbabwe. The Tonga oral records indicate that they came from the east near the ""big sea"".

They were later joined by the [[Tumbuka people]] who settled around [[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Zambia]] and Malawi.

These first Bantu people lived in large villages. They lacked an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and helped each other in times of field preparation for their crops. Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted as a result of the slash-and-burn technique of planting crops. The people also kept large herds of cattle, which formed an important part of their societies.<ref>{{Cite web|date=12 January 2019|title=Ila|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/early-bantu-settlers/ila/|access-date=27 October 2020|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030212745/https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/early-bantu-settlers/ila/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Great-Zimbabwe-ruins-outer-walls-3-1200.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]]/[[Shona people|Shona]] rulers of this kingdom dominated trade at Ingombe Ilede]]
The first Bantu communities in Zambia were highly self-sufficient. Early [[Missionary|European missionaries]] who settled in Southern Zambia noted the independence of these Bantu societies. One of these missionaries noted:
""[If] weapons for war, hunting, and domestic purposes are needed, the [Tonga] man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore. He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes, hoes, and other useful implements. He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge. His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile, and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained. He moulds, welds, shapes, and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith"".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of South and South Central Africa, by H.

These early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site [[Ingombe Ilede]] (which translates to sleeping cow in Tonga because the fallen baobab tree appears to resemble a cow) in Southern Zambia. At this trading site, they met numerous [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]]/[[Shona people|Shona]] traders from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders from the East African [[Swahili coast]]. Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe, others being the Swahili port cities such as [[Sofala]].

The goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included fabrics, beads, gold, and bangles. Some of these items came from what is today southern Democratic Republic of Congo and [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] while others came from as far away as India, China and the [[Arab world]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Origins of trade - Zambia Travel Guide|url=http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1084|access-date=28 October 2020|website=www.zambia-travel-guide.com|archive-date=2 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210802161402/http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1084|url-status=live}}</ref> The African traders were later joined by the Portuguese in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pikirayi|first=Innocent|date=August 2017|title=Ingombe Ilede and the demise of Great Zimbabwe|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=91|issue=358|pages=1085–1086|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.95|s2cid=158120419|issn=0003-598X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The decline of Great Zimbabwe, due to increasing trade competition from other Kalanga/Shona kingdoms like [[Khami]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]], spelt the end of Ingombe Ilede.

====Second Bantu settlement====
The second mass settlement of Bantu people into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the western route of the Bantu migration through the Congo Basin. These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 August 2019|title=Luba|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|access-date=7 November 2020|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en|archive-date=3 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103115702/https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|url-status=live}}</ref>

While there is some evidence that the [[Bemba people]] might have an ancient connection to the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo Kingdom]] through [[Kongo people|Kongo]] people ruler, [[Manikongo|Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba]], this is not well documented.

=====Luba-Lunda states=====
[[File:Mwata.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the ruler of [[Lunda people|Lunda]], [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]], receiving Portuguese in the royal courtyard in the 1800s]]
The Bemba, along with other related groups such as the [[Lamba people (Zambia)|Lamba]], [[Lala-Bisa language|Bisa]], [[Senga people|Senga]], [[Kaonde language|Kaonde]], Swaka, Nkoya and [[Soli language|Soli]], formed integral parts of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the [[Luba people]]. The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and iron workers since the 300s C.E.

Over time, these communities learned to use nets and harpoons, make dugout canoes, clear canals through swamps and make dams as high as {{convert|2.5|meters}}. As a result, they grew a diverse economy trading fish, copper and iron items and salt for goods from other parts of Africa, like the Swahili coast and, later on, the Portuguese. From these communities arose the Luba Kingdom in the 14th century.<ref name=""metmuseum.org"">{{Cite web|last=Bortolot|first=Alexander Ives|title=Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Luba and Lunda Empires|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|access-date=7 November 2020|website=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|date=October 2003 |archive-date=6 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106232343/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a centralised government and smaller independent [[chiefdom]]s. It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the [[Congo Basin]] and the mineral-rich plateaus of what is today [[Copperbelt Province]] and stretched from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] to the Indian Ocean coast. The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom, and artisans were held in high regard.<ref name=""metmuseum.org"" />

Literature was well developed in the Luba Kingdom. One renowned [[Luba people|Luba]] genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors goes as follows:

{{blockquote|[[Kongolo Mwamba|Nkongolo Mwamba]], the red king, and [[Ilunga Mbili|Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe]], a prince of legendary black complexion. Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot, Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe the refined and gentle prince. Nkongolo the Red is a man without manners, a man who eats in public, gets drunk, and cannot control himself, whereas [Ilunga] Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation, obsessed with good manners; he does not eat in public, controls his language and his behaviour, and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people. Nkongolo Mwamba symbolises the embodiment of tyranny, whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Luba {{!}} people|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Luba-people|access-date=7 November 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=26 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201026134446/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Luba-people|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A drawing of [[Lunda people|Lunda]] houses by a Portuguese visitor. The size of the doorways relative to the building emphasizes the scale of the buildings]]

In the same region of Southern Congo, the [[Lunda people]] were made into a satellite of the Luba empire and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance, thus becoming the Lunda Empire to the south. According to Lunda genesis myths, a Luba hunter named [[Tshibinda Ilunga|Chibinda Ilunga]], son of [[Ilunga Mbili|Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe]], introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around 1600 when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom. Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire. The Lunda kings, however, remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region.<ref name=""metmuseum.org"" />

The Lunda, like its parent state Luba, also traded with both coasts, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. While ruler [[List of rulers of the Lunda Empire|Mwaant Yaav Naweej]] had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for slaves and forest products and controlling the regional Copper trade, and settlements around [[Lake Mweru]] regulated commerce with the East African coast.<ref name=""metmuseum.org"" />

The Luba-Lunda states eventually declined as a result of both [[Atlantic slave trade]] in the west and [[Indian Ocean slave trade]] in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms. The [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], a group that is closely related to the [[Luvale people|Luvale]] and formed a Lunda satellite state, initially suffered from the European demand for slaves, but once they broke away from the Lunda state, they themselves became notorious slave traders, exporting slaves to both coasts.

The Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Azuonye|first=Chukwuma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&pg=PA11|title=Chokwe: (Angola, Zambia)|date=15 December 1996|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1|language=en}}</ref> This instability caused the collapse of the Luba-Lunda states and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba-Lunda and surrounding Central African states.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 August 2019|title=Luba|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|access-date=30 November 2020|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en|archive-date=3 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201103115702/https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=====The Maravi Confederacy=====
In the 1200s, before the founding of the Luba-Lunda states, a group of Bantu people started migrating from the [[Congo Basin]] to [[Lake Mweru]] then finally settled around [[Lake Malawi]]. These migrants are believed to have been one of the inhabitants around the [[Upemba Depression|Upemba]] area in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. By the 1400s these groups of migrants collectively called the Maravi, and most prominently among them was the [[Chewa people]] who started imitating other Bantu groups like the [[Tumbuka people|Tumbuka]].<ref name=""Team"">{{Cite web|last=Team|first=Editorial|date=26 December 2018|title=The Maravi Confederacy|url=https://thinkafrica.net/maravi-confederacy/|access-date=13 December 2020|website=Think Africa|language=en-US|archive-date=29 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129190111/https://thinkafrica.net/maravi-confederacy/|url-status=live}}</ref>[[File:Kalonga.jpg|thumb|left|The kalonga (ruler) of the [[Chewa people|Chewa]] today descends from the kalonga of the Maravi Empire]]

In 1480 the [[Maravi]] Empire was founded by the kalonga (paramount chief of the Maravi) from the Phiri clan, one of the main clans, with the others being Banda, Mwale and Nkhoma. The Maravi Empire stretched from the Indian Ocean through what today is [[Mozambique]] to Zambia and central parts of [[Malawi]]. The political organisation of the Maravi resembled that of the Luba and is believed to have originated from there. The primary export of the Maravi was ivory, which was transported to Swahili brokers.<ref name=""Team""/>

Iron was also manufactured and exported. In the 1590s the Portuguese endeavoured to take monopoly over Maravi export trade. This attempt was met with outrage by the Maravi of Lundu, who unleashed their WaZimba armed force. The WaZimba sacked the Portuguese trade towns of Tete, Sena and various other towns.<ref name=""thinkafrica.net"">{{Cite web|last=Team|first=Editorial|date=26 December 2018|title=The Maravi Confederacy|url=https://thinkafrica.net/maravi-confederacy/|access-date=14 December 2020|website=Think Africa|language=en-US|archive-date=29 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129190111/https://thinkafrica.net/maravi-confederacy/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Maravi are also believed to have brought the traditions that would become [[Nyau]] secret society from [[Upemba Depression|Upemba]]. The Nyau form the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people of Maravi. The [[Nyau]] society consists of ritual dance performances and masks used for the dances; this belief system spread around the region.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maptia|title=The Secret Cult of Nyau Dancers|url=https://maptia.com/vlad_sokhin/stories/the-secret-cult-of-nyau-dancers|access-date=3 January 2021|website=Maptia|language=en|archive-date=8 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108130415/https://maptia.com/vlad_sokhin/stories/the-secret-cult-of-nyau-dancers}}</ref>

The Maravi declined as a result of succession disputes within the confederacy, attack by the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] and slave raids from the [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]].<ref name=""thinkafrica.net""/>

=====Mutapa Empire and Mfecane=====
[[File:Ngoni Chiefs.jpg|thumb|Three young [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] chiefs. The Ngoni made their way into [[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Zambia]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu]] in South Africa. They eventually assimilated into the local ethnic groups.]]
As [[Great Zimbabwe]] was in decline, one of its princes, [[Nyatsimba Mutota]], broke away from the state forming a new empire called [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]]. The title of Mwene Mutapa, meaning ""Ravager of the Lands"", was bestowed on him and subsequent rulers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mwene Matapa {{!}} historical dynastic title, southern Africa|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mwene-Matapa|access-date=31 December 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=20 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230520141810/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mwene-Matapa|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Mutapa Empire ruled territory between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Limpopo]] rivers, in what is now Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, from the 14th to the 17th century. By its, peak Mutapa had conquered the Dande area of the [[Tonga people (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]] and Tavara. The Mutapa Empire predominately engaged in the Indian Ocean transcontinental trade with and via the [[WaSwahili]]. The primary exported gold and ivory for silk and ceramics from Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mutapa|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Mutapa/|access-date=31 December 2020|website=World History Encyclopedia|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418202600/https://www.worldhistory.org/Mutapa/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Like their contemporaries in Maravi, Mutapa had problems with the arriving Portuguese traders. The peak of this uneasy relationship was reached when the Portuguese attempted to influence the kingdoms internal affairs by establishing markets in the kingdom and converting the population to Christianity. This action caused outrage by the Muslim WaSwahili living in the capital, this chaos gave the Portuguese the excuse they were searching for to warrant an attack on the kingdom and try to control its gold mines and ivory routes. This attack failed when the Portuguese succumbed to disease along the Zambezi river.<ref name=""Mutapa"">{{Cite web|title=Mutapa|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Mutapa/|access-date=1 January 2021|website=World History Encyclopedia|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418202600/https://www.worldhistory.org/Mutapa/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1600s internal disputes and civil war began the decline of Mutapa. The weakened kingdom was finally conquered by the Portuguese and was eventually taken over by rival [[Shona people|Shona]] states.<ref name=""Mutapa""/>

The Portuguese also had vast estates, known as Prazos, and they used slaves and ex-slaves as security guards and hunters. They trained the men in military tactics and gave them guns. These men became expert elephant hunters and were known as the [[Chikunda]]. After the decline of the Portuguese the Chikunda made their way to Zambia.<ref>{{Cite web|date=11 January 2019|title=Chikunda|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/mozambique/chikunda/|access-date=12 January 2021|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en|archive-date=27 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227184451/https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/mozambique/chikunda/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[File:Litunga.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the palace of the [[Litunga]], ruler of the Lozi. Due to the flooding on the Zambezi, the Litunga has two palaces one of which is on higher ground. The movement of Litunga to higher land is celebrated at the [[Kuomboka]] Ceremony]]

It is hypothesised by [[Julian Cobbing]] that the presence of early [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] [[History of slavery|slave trading]] and attempts to control resources in various parts of [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking Africa]] caused the gradual militarisation of the people in the region. This can be observed with the Maravi's WaZimba warrior caste, who, once defeating the Portuguese, remained quite militaristic afterwards.

The Portuguese presence in the region was also a major reason for the founding of the [[Rozvi Empire]], a breakaway state of Mutapa. The ruler of the Rozvi, Changamire Dombo, became one of the most powerful leaders in South-Central Africa's history. Under his leadership, the Rozvi defeated the Portuguese and expelled them from their trading posts along the Zambezi river.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rozwi {{!}} historical state, Africa|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rozwi-historical-state-Africa|access-date=2 January 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=25 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125203243/https://www.britannica.com/place/Rozwi-historical-state-Africa|url-status=live}}</ref>

But perhaps the most notable instance of this increased militarisation was the rise of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] under the leadership of [[Shaka]]. Pressures from the English colonialists in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] and increased militarisation of the Zulu resulted in the [[Mfecane]] (the crushing). The Zulu expanded by assimilating the women and children of tribes they defeated, if the men of these [[Nguni people|Nguni tribes]] escaped slaughter, they used the military tactics of the Zulu to attack other groups.<ref name=""Mfecane {{!}} African history"">{{Cite web|title=Mfecane {{!}} African history|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Mfecane|access-date=2 January 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=12 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112032255/https://www.britannica.com/event/Mfecane|url-status=live}}</ref>

This caused mass displacements, wars and raids throughout Southern, Central and Eastern Africa as Nguni or [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] tribes made their way throughout the region and is referred to as the Mfecane. The arriving Nguni under the leadership of [[Zwangendaba|Zwagendaba]] crossed the Zambezi river moving northwards. The Ngoni were the final blow to the already weakened [[Maravi]] Empire. Many Nguni eventually settled around what is today Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania and assimilated into neighbouring tribes.<ref name=""Mfecane {{!}} African history""/>

In the [[Western Province, Zambia|western part]] of Zambia, another Southern African group of [[Sotho-Tswana peoples|Sotho-Tswana]] heritage called the [[Kololo people|Kololo]] manage to conquer the local inhabitants who were migrants from the fallen Luba and Lunda states called the [[Luyana language|Luyana]] or Aluyi. The Luyana established the [[Barotseland|Barotse Kingdom]] on the [[Barotse Floodplain|floodplains of the Zambezi]] upon their arrival from Katanga. Under the Kololo, the Kololo language was imposed upon the Luyana until the Luyana revolted and overthrew the Kololo by this time the Luyana language was largely forgotten and a new hybrid language emerged, [[Lozi language|SiLozi]] and the Luyana began to refer to themselves as [[Lozi people|Lozi]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lozi {{!}} people|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lozi|access-date=2 January 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=28 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230528092724/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lozi|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the end of the 18th century, some of the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] migrated to [[Barotseland]], [[Mongu]] upon the migration of among others, the [[Rulers of Mbundaland|Ciyengele]].<ref>'' The elites of Barotseland, 1878–1969: a political history of Zambia's Western Province'': a.

One of the earliest recorded Europeans to visit the area was the Portuguese explorer [[Francisco de Lacerda]] in the late 18th century.

Other European visitors followed in the 19th century. The most prominent of these was [[David Livingstone]], who had a vision of ending the slave trade through the ""3 Cs"": Christianity, Commerce, and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]] in 1855, naming them the [[Victoria Falls]] after [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom. He described them thus: ""Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight"".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Livingstone Discovers Victoria Falls, 1855|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/livingstone.htm|website=EyeWitness to History|access-date=28 May 2020|archive-date=22 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522092057/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/livingstone.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Locally the falls are known as [[Mosi-oa-Tunya|""Mosi-o-Tunya""]] or ""thundering smoke"" in the Lozi or Kololo dialect. The town of [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], near the Falls, is named after him.

In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the region, and it was during this trek that Burnham discovered major copper deposits along the [[Kafue River]].<ref name=""burnham1899"">{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |author-link=Frederick Russell Burnham |editor-first=Walter H. |editor-last=Wills |title=Bulawayo Up-to-date; Being a General Sketch of Rhodesia |publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co. |year=1899 |pages=177–180 |chapter=Northern Rhodesia|title-link=s:Northern Rhodesia }}</ref>

North-Eastern Rhodesia and Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia were administered as separate units until 1911 when they were merged to form Northern Rhodesia, a British protectorate. In 1923, the BSA Company ceded control of Northern Rhodesia to the British Government after the government decided not to renew the company's charter.

====British colonisation====

In 1923, [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe), a conquered territory which was also administered by the BSA Company, became a self-governing British colony. In 1924, after negotiations, the administration of Northern Rhodesia transferred to the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]].

;Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland{{clear}}
In 1953, the creation of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] grouped together Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and [[Nyasaland Protectorate|Nyasaland]] (now Malawi) as a single semi-autonomous region. This was undertaken despite opposition from a sizeable minority of the population, who demonstrated against it in 1960–61.<ref name=""infoplease"">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0841738.html|title=Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Federation of|author=Pearson Education|access-date=29 October 2007|archive-date=12 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012231959/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0841738.html}}</ref> Northern Rhodesia was the centre of much of the turmoil and crisis characterising the federation in its last years. Initially, [[Harry Nkumbula]]'s [[Zambian African National Congress|African National Congress]] (ANC) led the campaign, which [[Kenneth Kaunda]]'s United National Independence Party (UNIP) subsequently took up.

===Independence===

[[File:Zambia123f.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth David Kaunda|Kenneth Kaunda]], first president, on a state visit to [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] in 1970]]

A two-stage election held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]] based on a broader, more democratic franchise.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963, and in January 1964, Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia. The [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia|Colonial Governor]], Sir [[Evelyn Dennison Hone|Evelyn Hone]], was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post. Soon after, there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the [[Lumpa Church|Lumpa Uprising]] led by [[Alice Lenshina]]&nbsp;– Kaunda's first internal conflict as leader of the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alice Lenshina|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/alicelenshinalumpa.htm|date=26 May 2020|website=The British Empire|access-date=26 May 2020|archive-date=28 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228081501/https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/alicelenshinalumpa.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Northern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as the first president. At independence, despite its considerable mineral wealth, Zambia faced major challenges. Domestically, there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government, and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise. This expertise was provided in part by British diplomat [[John Willson (diplomat)|John Willson]].<ref>[http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/collections/BDOHP/Willson.pdf WILLSON, John Michael (born 15 July 1931)]{{Dead link|date=June 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

On 3 September 1978, civilian airliner, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 825]], was shot down near Kariba by the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA). 18 people, including children, survived the crash only for most of them to be shot by militants of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) led by [[Joshua Nkomo]]. Rhodesia responded with [[Operation Gatling]], an attack on Nkomo's guerilla bases in Zambia, in particular, his military headquarters just outside Lusaka; this raid became known as the Green Leader Raid. On the same day, two more bases in Zambia were attacked using air power and elite paratroops and helicopter-borne troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helion.co.uk/new-and-forthcoming-titles/green-leader-operation-gatling-the-rhodesian-military-s-response-to-the-viscount-tragedy.html|title=GREEN LEADER.

A railway ([[TAZARA Railway|TAZARA]] – Tanzania Zambia Railways) to the Tanzanian port of [[Dar es Salaam]], completed in 1975 with Chinese assistance, reduced Zambian dependence on railway lines south to South Africa and west through an increasingly troubled [[Portuguese Angola]]. Until the completion of the railway, Zambia's major artery for imports and the critical export of copper was along the [[Tanzam Highway|TanZam Road]], running from Zambia to the port cities in Tanzania. The [[Tazama Pipeline|Tazama oil pipeline]] was also built from Dar es Salaam to [[Ndola]] in Zambia.

By the late 1970s, Mozambique and Angola had attained independence from Portugal. Rhodesia's predominantly white government, which issued a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965, accepted majority rule under the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in 1979.<ref name=""zimstudy"">{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Harold|title=Zimbabwe: A Country Study|pages=54–137|year=1983|isbn=978-0-16-001598-4|publisher=Claitors Publishing Division}}</ref>

The [[Benguela railway]], which extended west through Angola, was essentially closed to Zambian traffic by the late 1970s. Zambia's support for [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] movements such as the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) also created security problems as the [[South African Defence Force]] struck at dissident targets during external raids.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Evans, M. |title=The Front-Line States, South Africa and Southern African Security: Military Prospects and Perspectives |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol12n1/juz012001002.pdf |page=1 |journal=Zambezia |year=1984 |volume=12}}</ref>

In 1989, two of Zambia's natural sites, [[Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park]] and [[Victoria Falls]] were inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].

====Economic troubles====

In the mid-1970s, the price of copper, Zambia's principal export, suffered a severe decline worldwide. In Zambia's situation, the cost of transporting the copper great distances to the market was an additional strain. Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief, but, as copper prices remained depressed, it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt. By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia (12/08)|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/zambia/102331.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=27 May 2020|archive-date=25 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625080205/https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/zambia/102331.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006–2007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Zambia}}

[[File:Zambia National Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|Zambia National Assembly building in [[Lusaka]]]]

Politics in Zambia takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[president of Zambia]] is both head of state and head of government in a pluriform<!--Does this add anything to multi-party system?--> [[multi-party system]]. The government exercises executive power, while legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.

Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining independence in October 1964.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Zambia|Geology of Zambia}}

[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map ZMB present.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Zambia map of Köppen climate classification]]
Zambia is a [[landlocked country]] in southern Africa, with a tropical climate, and consists mostly of high plateaus with some hills and mountains, dissected by river valleys. At {{convert|752614|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than [[Chile]]. The country lies mostly between latitudes 8° and 18°S, and longitudes 22° and 34°E.

Zambia is drained by two major river basins: the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]]/Kafue basin in the centre, west, and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal [[drainage basin]] of [[Lake Rukwa]] in Tanzania.

In the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]], [[Lungwebungu River|Lungwebungu]], [[Kafue River|Kafue]], [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]], and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the [[Cuando River]] floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the [[Chobe River]] that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most are lost by evaporation.<ref name=""Beilfuss"">Beilfuss, Richard and dos Santos, David (2001) [http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf ""Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique"".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180850/http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley.</ref>

Two of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa town]] respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with Mozambique. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the [[Mozambique Channel]].

The Zambezi falls about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} over the {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|abbr=off|adj=mid|-wide}} Victoria Falls, located in the southwest corner of the country, subsequently flowing into [[Lake Kariba]]. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east, it is formed by [[graben]]s and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, [[Mweru-wa-Ntipa]] and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a [[rift valley]].

The north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the [[Barotse Floodplain]] on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The flood dominates the natural environment and the lives, society, and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.

In Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and [[Lake Tanganyika]] valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the south to {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the centre, reaching {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the north near Mbala. These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as a large section of the [[Central Zambezian miombo woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Geography {{!}} Zambian High Commission|url=https://www.zambiapretoria.net/geography/|website=www.zambiapretoria.net|access-date=27 May 2020|archive-date=26 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426145145/https://www.zambiapretoria.net/geography/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Eastern Zambia shows great diversity. The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north-east to south-west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the [[Lunsemfwa River]]. Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley, notably in its north-east the Nyika Plateau ({{convert|2200|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the Malawi border, which extend into Zambia as the [[Mafinga Hills]], containing the country's highest point, [[Mafinga Central]] ({{convert|2339|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/mafinga-south-and-mafinga-central-the-highest-peaks-in-zambia/ |title=Mafinga South and Mafinga Central: the highest peaks in Zambia |date=24 September 2014 |publisher=Footsteps on the Mountain blog |access-date=16 October 2014 |archive-date=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716161825/http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/mafinga-south-and-mafinga-central-the-highest-peaks-in-zambia/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Muchinga Mountains, the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins, run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge, although they are almost everywhere below {{convert|1700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at {{convert|1892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region. The border of the [[Congo Pedicle]] was drawn around this mountain.

The southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]] and then, after the [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu Swamps]] as the [[Luapula River|Luapula]], which forms part of the border with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters [[Lake Mweru]]. The lake's other major tributary is the [[Kalungwishi River]], which flows into it from the east. The [[Luvua River]] drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the [[Lualaba River]] (Upper Congo River).

[[Lake Tanganyika]] is the other major hydrographic feature that belongs to the Congo basin. Its south-eastern end receives water from the [[Kalambo River]], which forms part of Zambia's border with Tanzania. This river has Africa's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, the [[Kalambo Falls]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Zambia}}
Zambia is located on the plateau of Central Africa, between {{convert|1000|and|1600|m|ft}} above sea level. The average elevation of {{convert|1200|m|ft}} gives the land a generally moderate climate. The climate of Zambia is tropical, modified by elevation. In the [[Köppen climate classification]], most of the country is classified as [[humid subtropical]] or [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]], with small stretches of semi-arid [[steppe climate]] in the south-west and along the [[Zambezi valley]].

There are two main seasons, the rainy season (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the dry season (May/June to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May/June to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant [[subtropical]] weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August.<ref>''Spectrum Guide to Zambia''. Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996. {{ISBN|1-874041-14-8}}.</ref> However, average monthly temperatures remain above {{convert|20|°C}} over most of the country for eight or more months of the year.

{{Historical census population in Zambia}}
{{Main|Demographics of Zambia}}
As of the [[2022 Zambian census]], Zambia's population was 19,610,769.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia's Population up to 19,610,769 in 2022 from 13,092,666 in 2010 – Zambia Statistics Agency |url=https://www.zamstats.gov.zm/population-size-by-sex-and-rural-urban-zambia-2022/ |access-date=2024-03-27 |language=en-US |archive-date=5 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240305022051/https://www.zamstats.gov.zm/population-size-by-sex-and-rural-urban-zambia-2022/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During its colonial administration by the British between 1911 and 1963, the country attracted immigrants from Europe and the Indian subcontinent, the latter of whom came as indentured workers. While most Europeans left after the collapse of white-minority rule, many Asians remained. Zambia is home to a growing Asian community, with a majority being of Indian and Chinese descent.

[[File:Umutomboko ceremony.jpg|thumb|The [[Mwata Kazembe]] opens the Mutomboko ceremony]]
In the first census—conducted on 7 May 1911—there were a total of 1,497 Europeans; 39 Asiatics and an estimated 820,000 black Africans. Black Africans were not counted in the six censuses conducted in 1911, 1921, 1931, 1946, 1951 and 1956, prior to independence, but their population was estimated. By 1956, there were 65,277 Europeans, 5,450 Asiatics, 5,450 coloureds and an estimated 2,100,000 black Africans.

The main ethnic groups in Zambia are Bemba 3.3 million (33.6%), Nyanja 1.8 million (18.2%), Tonga 1.7 million (16.8%), North-Western peoples 1 million (10.3%), Lozi (Barotse) 770,000 (7.8%), Mambwe 580,000 (5.9%), Tumbuka 500,000 (5.1%), Lamba 165,000 (2%), Asians 11,900 and Europeans 6,200.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://minorityrights.org/country/zambia/|title=Zambia|website=minorityrights.org|date=2 November 2023|access-date=6 March 2024|archive-date=9 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230909114747/https://minorityrights.org/country/zambia/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Largest towns===
{{Further|List of cities and towns in Zambia}}The onset of industrial copper mining on the Copperbelt in the late 1920s triggered rapid urbanisation.

Economic decline in the Copperbelt from the 1970s to the 1990s has altered patterns of urban development, but the country's population remains concentrated around the railway and roads running south from the Copperbelt through Kapiri Mposhi, Lusaka, Choma and Livingstone.

Immigrants, mostly British or South African, as well as some white Zambian citizens of British descent, live mainly in Lusaka and in the Copperbelt in northern Zambia, where they are either employed in mines, financial and related activities or retired.

Zambia has a minority of people of colour of mixed race, also known as coloureds. Coloureds in Zambia no longer appear on the census. During colonialism, [[Racial segregation|segregation]] separated people of colour, blacks and whites in public places including schools, hospitals, and in housing. There has been an increase in interracial relationships due to Zambia's growing economy importing labor. People of colour are not recorded on the census but are considered a minority in Zambia.

According to the ''World Refugee Survey 2009'' published by the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], Zambia had a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 88,900. The majority of refugees in the country came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (47,300 refugees from the DRC living in Zambia in 2007), Angola (27,100; see [[Angolans in Zambia]]), Zimbabwe (5,400) and Rwanda (4,900).<ref name=""World Refugee Survey 2009""/> Zambians are generally welcoming towards foreigners.

Christianity arrived to Zambia through European colonialism, and its wide variety of sects and movements reflect changing patterns of missionary activity; for example, Catholicism came from Portuguese Mozambique in the east, while Anglicanism reflects British influences from the south. Following its independence in 1964, Zambia saw a greater influx of other church missions from across the world, particularly North America and Germany. In subsequent decades, Western missionary roles have been assumed by native believers (except for some technical positions, such as physicians). After [[Frederick Chiluba]], a Pentecostal Christian, became president in 1991, Pentecostal congregations expanded considerably around the country.<ref name=""pentecostal"">{{cite book|last=Steel |first=Matthew |title=Pentecostalism in Zambia: Power, Authority and the Overcomers|id=MSc Dissertation|publisher=University of Wales|year=2005}}</ref>

The exact number of Zambian languages is unknown, although many texts claim that Zambia has 73 languages and/or dialects; this figure is probably due to a non-distinction between language and dialect, based on the criterion of mutual intelligibility. On this basis, the number of Zambian languages would probably be only about 20 or 30.<ref name=""Chanda, Vincent M., and, Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson. 2013 1–173"">{{Cite book|author1=Chanda, Vincent M. |author2=Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson |title=Speak Zambian Languages: Phrase Book in Bemba, Kaonde, Lozi, Luvale, Lunda, Nyanja and Tonga, all in one|publisher=UNZA Press|year=2013|isbn=978-9982-03-073-1|location=Lusaka, Zambia|pages=1–173}}</ref>

The official language of Zambia is English, which is used for official business, education, and law.<ref name=BritannicaPeople/> The main local language, especially in Lusaka, is [[Nyanja]] (Chewa), followed by [[Bemba language|Bemba]]. In the Copperbelt, Bemba is the main language and Nyanja second. Bemba and Nyanja are spoken in the urban areas, in addition to other indigenous languages that are commonly spoken in Zambia. These include [[Lozi language|Lozi]], [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]], [[Kaonde]], [[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]], [[Lunda languages|Lunda]] and [[Luvale]], which featured on the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC) local-languages section.<ref name=BritannicaPeople/><ref name=""Chanda, Vincent M., and, Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson. 2013 1–173""/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson.|title=The State of Affairs of Cultural Literacy in Zambia's Multicultural Education System.

Urbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages, including the assimilation of words from other languages. Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with 'deep'.

Most will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt; Nyanja is predominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia. English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among&nbsp;– now common&nbsp;– interethnic families. This evolution of languages has led to Zambian slang heard throughout Lusaka and other major cities. The majority of Zambians usually speak more than one language: the official language, English, and the most spoken language in the town or area they live in. Portuguese has been introduced as a second language into the school curriculum due to the presence of a large Portuguese-speaking Angolan community.<ref>[http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/zambia-to-introduce-portuguese-into-school-curriculum-2009041825794.html Zambia to introduce Portuguese into school curriculum]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208151924/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/zambia-to-introduce-portuguese-into-school-curriculum-2009041825794.html |date=8 December 2012 }}</ref> French is commonly studied in private schools, while some secondary schools have it as an optional subject.

Zambia fell into poverty after international copper prices declined in the 1970s. The socialist regime made up for falling revenue with several abortive attempts at [[International Monetary Fund]] [[structural adjustment]] programmes (SAPs). The policy of not trading through the main supply route and line of rail to the sea&nbsp;– the territory was known as Rhodesia (from 1965 to 1979), and now known as Zimbabwe&nbsp;– cost the economy greatly. After the Kaunda regime, (from 1991) successive governments began limited reforms. The economy stagnated until the late 1990s. In 2007 Zambia recorded its ninth consecutive year of economic growth. Inflation was 8.9%, down from 30% in 2000.<ref name=""dos2009""/>

Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point, and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003.

[[File:GDP per capita (current), % of world average, 1960-2012; Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique.png|thumb|upright=1.5|GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average = 100)]]
In January 2003, the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and [[World Bank]] that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities. Although agreements were reached on these issues, subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambia's final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005, at the earliest. In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004, the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004, freezing civil service salaries and increasing the number of taxes. The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090724213759/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2108 The World Bank and IMF's long shadow in Zambia's copper mines]. eurodad.org. 20 February 2008</ref>

The Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification programme to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry. This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambia's rich resource base by promoting agriculture, tourism, gemstone mining, and hydro-power.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture plays a very important part in Zambia's economy providing many more jobs than the mining industry.

==Culture==
[[File:Nsima Relishes.JPG|thumb|''[[Nsima]]'' (top right corner) with three types of [[relish]].]]
Prior to the establishment of modern Zambia, the inhabitants lived in independent tribes, each with its own way of life. One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other's way of life. They also started adopting aspects of global or universal culture, especially in terms of dressing and mannerisms.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206"">{{Cite book|author1=Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson |author2=Simooya, Steriah Monica |author3=Monde, Pauline Namakau |title=Zambian Culture: Harnessing Cultural Literacy with a Focus on Myths and Taboos|publisher=UNZA Press|year=2019|isbn=978-9982-03-105-9|location=Lusaka, Zambia|pages=1–206}}</ref> Much of the original cultures of Zambia have largely survived in rural areas, with some outside influences such as Christianity. Cultures that are specific to certain ethnic groups within Zambia are known as 'Zambian cultures' while those lifestyles that are common across ethnic groups are labelled ""Zambian culture"" because they are practiced by almost every Zambian.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> In the urban setting, there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is called ""Zambian culture"".

[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Yombe people|Yombe]] sculpture, 19th century.]]
Zambia practices several ceremonies and rituals ranging from nationally recognised traditional ceremonies to unrecognised yet important ceremonies. Many of the ceremonies and rituals are performed on special occasions celebrating or marking achievements, anniversaries, the passage of time, coronations and presidential occasions, atonement and purification, graduation, dedication, oaths of allegiance, initiation, marriage, funeral, birth ceremonies and others.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/>

Like most African countries, Zambia practices both disclosed and undisclosed ceremonies and rituals. Among the disclosed ceremonies and rituals include calendrical or seasonal, contingent, affliction, divination, initiation and regular or daily ceremonies.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> Undisclosed ceremonies include those practiced in secret such by spiritual groups like Nyau and Nakisha dancers and traditional marriage counsellors such as alangizi women.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> As of December 2016, Zambia had 77 calendrical or seasonal traditional ceremonies recognized by government, and this number will increase in the near future.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> The ceremonies once a year include Nc'wala, Kulonga, Kuomboka, Malaila, Nsengele, Chibwela kumushi, Dantho, Ntongo, Makundu, Lwiindi, Chuungu, and Lyenya. These are known as [[Zambian traditional ceremonies]]. Some of the more prominent are: [[Kuomboka]] and [[Kathanga]] (Western Province), [[Kazembe#Mutomboko Festival|Mutomboko]] (Luapula Province), [[Kulamba ceremony|Kulamba]] and [[Ncwala]] (Eastern Province), [[Lwiindi]] and [[Shimunenga]] (Southern Province), [[Lunda Lubanza]] (North Western), [[Likumbi Lyamize]] (North Western),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ellert|first=Henrik|title=The magic of the makishi: masks and traditions in Zambia|publisher=CBC publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-9515209-9-7|location=Bath, UK|pages=38–63}}</ref> [[Mbunda Lukwakwa]] (North Western Province), [[Chibwela Kumushi]] (Central Province), [[Vinkhakanimba]] (Muchinga Province), [[Ukusefya Pa Ng'wena]] (Northern Province).

Popular traditional arts include pottery, basketry (such as [[Tonga baskets]]), stools, fabrics, mats, wooden carvings, ivory carvings, wire craft, and copper crafts. Most [[Music of Zambia|Zambian traditional music]] is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In urban areas, foreign genres of music are popular, particularly Congolese [[Soukous|rumba]], African-American music and Jamaican reggae.

===Media===
{{Main|Media in Zambia|Telecommunications in Zambia}}
Freedoms of expression and of the press are [[constitution]]ally guaranteed in Zambia, but the government frequently restricts these rights in practice.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |title=Press Freedom survey on 186 countries |url=http://www.worldaudit.org/presstable.html |access-date=2017-01-13 |website=Worldaudit.org |archive-date=1 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201071942/http://www.worldaudit.org/presstable.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |title=Zambia {{!}} Country report {{!}} Freedom of the Press {{!}} 2016 |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/zambia |access-date=2017-01-14 |website=Freedomhouse.org |archive-date=16 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116155841/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/zambia }}</ref> Although the ruling Patriotic Front has pledged to free state-owned media—consisting of the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC) and the widely circulated ''[[Zambia Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Times of Zambia]]''—from government editorial control, these outlets have generally continued to report along pro-government lines. Many journalists reportedly practice [[self-censorship]] since most government newspapers do have prepublication review.<ref name="":0"" /> The ZNBC dominates the broadcast media, though several private stations have the capacity to reach large portions of the population.

===Sports and games===
Sports and games are common social aspects of Zambian culture(s) that bring people together for learning, development of skills, fun and joyous moments.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> Sports and games in Zambia include but are not limited to football, athletics, netball, volleyball and indigenous games such as nsolo, chiyenga, waida, hide and seek, walyako, and sojo.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> These are some of the indigenous games that support socialisation. All these sports and games are part of the Zambian culture(s). The fact that the games are played by more than one person makes them social and edutainment events.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/> The history of some of these games is as old as Zambians themselves. However, Zambia started taking part in popular global sports and games mainly in 1964 Summer olympics.<ref name=""Mkandawire, Sitwe Benson., Simooya, Steriah Monica., and Monde, Pauline Namakau. 2019 1–206""/>

Zambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic Games as one country and left it as another. In 2016, Zambia participated for the thirteenth time in the Olympic games. Two medals were won. The medals were won successively in boxing and on the track. In 1984 Keith Mwila won a bronze medal in the light flyweight. In 1996 Samuel Matete won a silver medal in the 400-metre hurdles. Zambia has never participated in the Winter Olympics.

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Zambia, and the [[Zambia national football team]] has had its triumphant moments in football history. At the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], the national team defeated the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] by a score of 4–0. [[Kalusha Bwalya]], Zambia's most celebrated football player, scored a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|plane crash]] at [[Libreville]], [[Gabon]]. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the [[African Cup of Nations]] for the first time after losing in the final twice. They beat Côte d'Ivoire 8–7 in a penalty shoot-out in the final, which was played in Libreville, just a few kilometers away from the plane crash 19 years previously.<ref name=""Africa Cup"">{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/zambia-score-emotional-african-cup-win-20120213-1t0fb.html|title=Zambia score emotional African Cup win|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=11 February 2012|date=13 February 2012|archive-date=18 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718035537/http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/zambia-score-emotional-african-cup-win-20120213-1t0fb.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Zambia women's national football team]] made its [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] debut at [[2023 FIFA Women's World Cup|the 2023 tournament]] in Australia and New Zealand, the Zambia team being one of four representing the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF).

[[Rugby Union]], [[boxing]] and [[cricket]] are also popular sports in Zambia. Notably, at one point in the early 2000s, the Australia and South Africa national rugby teams were captained by players born in the same [[Lusaka]] hospital, [[George Gregan]] and [[Corné Krige]]. Until 2014, the Roan Antelope Rugby Club in Luanshya held the Guinness World Record for the tallest rugby union goal posts in the world at 110&nbsp;ft, 6 inches high.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Book of rugby disasters & bizarre records|date=1985|publisher=Stanley Paul|author1=Fran Cotton |author2=Chris Rhys|isbn=0-09-162821-0|location=London|page=107|oclc=16923880}}</ref> This world record is now held by the [[Wednesbury Rugby Club]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tallest rugby union posts|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/63633-tallest-rugby-union-posts|access-date=2021-10-13|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|archive-date=2 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230102231258/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/63633-tallest-rugby-union-posts|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Rugby union in Zambia]] is a minor but growing sport. They are currently ranked 73rd by the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] and have 3,650 registered players and three ''formally organised'' clubs.<ref name=IRB>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104518/http://www.irb.com/unions/union%3D11000028/index.html Zambia].

In 2011, Zambia was due to host the [[2011 All-Africa Games|tenth All-Africa Games]], for which three stadiums were to be built in [[Lusaka]], [[Ndola]], and [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]].<ref name=""games"">{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200602/22/eng20060222_244775.html|title=Zambia to build three stadia for 2011 All-Africa Games|publisher=People's Daily Online|access-date=6 November 2007|archive-date=24 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924005753/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200602/22/eng20060222_244775.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The Lusaka stadium would have a capacity of 70,000 spectators while the other two stadiums would hold 50,000 people each. The government was encouraging the private sector to get involved in the construction of the sports facilities because of a shortage of public funds for the project. Zambia later withdrew its bid to host the 2011 All-Africa Games, citing a lack of funds. Hence, Mozambique took Zambia's place as host.

Zambia also produced the first black African ([[Madalitso Muthiya]]) to play in the [[United States Golf Open]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2008/05/05/a-rare-talent-from-an-unusual-source/|title=Zambia's Madalitso Muthiya a pioneer|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=5 May 2008|access-date=18 September 2013|archive-date=4 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222257/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-05/sports/0805040183_1_zambia-frederick-chiluba-nationwide-tour|url-status=live}}</ref> one of the four major golf tournaments.

===Music and dance===
Zambia's culture has been an integral part of their development post-independence such as the uprising of cultural villages and private museums. The music which introduced dance is part of their cultural expression and it embodies the beauty and spectacle of life in Zambia, from the intricacies of the talking drums to the ''Kamangu'' drum used to announce the beginning of ''Malaila'' traditional ceremony. Dance as a practice serves as a unifying factor bringing the people together as one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ayibamagazine.com/unrivaled-zambian-culture/|title=The Unrivaled Zambian Culture|website=Ayiba Magazine|date=14 June 2016|access-date=30 June 2016|archive-date=30 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330174848/http://ayibamagazine.com/unrivaled-zambian-culture/}}</ref>

After sporadic visits by European explorers starting in the 18th century, Zambia was gradually claimed and occupied by the [[British Empire|British]] as protectorate of [[Northern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. On 24 October 1964, the protectorate gained independence with the new name of Zambia, derived from the [[Zambezi]] river which flows through the country. After independence the country moved towards a system of [[one-party state|one party rule]] with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as president. Kaunda dominated Zambian politics until multiparty elections were held in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

After sporadic visits by European explorers starting in the 18th century, Zambia was gradually claimed and occupied by the [[British Empire|British]] as protectorate of [[Northern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. On 24 October 1964, the protectorate gained independence with the new name of Zambia, derived from the [[Zambezi]] river which flows through the country. After independence the country moved towards a system of [[one-party state|one party rule]] with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as president. Kaunda dominated Zambian politics until multiparty elections were held in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Location==
The refinery is located in [[Ndola]], [[Ndola District]], [[Copperbelt Province]], approximately {{convert|8|km|0}}, by road, southeast of the city's [[central business district]].<ref name=""2R"">{{google maps|title=Road Distance Between Downton Ndola And Indeni Petroleum Refinery |access-date=16 May 2020 | url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Ndola,+Zambia/Indeni+Petroleum+Refinery+Company+Limited,+Ndola,+Zambia/@-13.0780643,28.6386516,17302m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x196cb4e3a782fdc7:0x540fdfe500034f23!2m2!1d28.6498144!2d-12.9906407!1m5!1m1!1s0x19134cce1ab99805:0x50ef160311009918!2m2!1d28.6797623!2d-13.0384302!3e0}}</ref> The geographical coordinates of the refinery are:13°02'21.0""S, 28°40'48.0""E (Latitude:-13.039167; Longitude:28.680000).<ref name=""3R"">{{google maps|title=Location of Indeni Petroleum Refinery | url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/13%C2%B002'21.0%22S+28%C2%B040'48.0%22E/@-13.0511634,28.8161507,34607m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d-13.0391667!4d28.68 |access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref>

==Overview==
The petroleum refinery is described in some publications as a ""very small and simple refinery"". It was constructed in 1973, with capacity to refine 24,000 bbl/d of crude oil, and process {{convert|1200000|tonne|0}} of feedstock annually. Crude oil is imported via the Kurasini Oil Jetty in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] and is delivered to the refinery through the {{convert|1704|km|0}} [[Tazama Pipeline]]. The annual delivery capacity of the pipeline is also the annual processing capacity of the refinery.<ref name=""4R"">{{cite web| url=http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/indeni-petroleum-refinery |title=Overview of Indeni Petroleum Ndola Refinery |publisher=A Barrel Full |date=16 May 2020 |author=A Barrel Full |access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref>

== Operations ==
The Indeni Refinery is configured as a [[Hydroskimming|Hydro-skimming]] refinery. Designed in 1973, the refinery is not able to refine pure crude at commercial levels and processes spiked crude.<ref name=""5R"">{{cite web|date=2009 | author=UNCTAD |  url=https://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditcclp2011d1_en.pdf | title=The Petroleum Industry In Zambia: A Study On Market Structure And Competition |publisher=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) |access-date=16 May 2020 |location=Geneva Switzerland}}</ref>

The refinery is able to produce the following products:<ref name=""4R""/> (a) [[unleaded petrol]] (b) automotive gas oil (c) industrial kerosene (d) domestic kerosene (e) [[Jet fuel]] (f) [[Liquefied Petroleum Gas]] (g) [[reformate]] (h) [[fuel oil]] and (i) [[Bitumen|asphalt]].<ref name=""4R""/>

==Ownership==
When the refinery was established in 1973, it was owned and managed by ''Indeni Petroleum Refinery Company Limited'', a 50/50 joint venture between the [[government of Zambia]] and [[Eni]], the [[Italy|Italian]] energy conglomerate, through their subsidiary ''Agip Zambia''. Under the terms of the joint venture, Eni was responsible for the management of the refinery.<ref name=""4R""/> In 2001, Eni sold their shareholding to [[Total S.A.]], through their subsidiary ''TotalFinaElf''. Total took over management of the refinery.<ref name=""6R"">{{cite web| url=http://killajoules.wikidot.com/archive:totalfinaelf-acquires-refining-interests-and-strengt |title=TotalFinaElf Acquires Refining Interests And Strengthens Marketing Network In Zambia | publisher=Killajoules.wikidot.com |date=27 November 2001 | author=A Barrel Full |access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> In 2009, Total S.A. sold their shareholding to the Zambian government for consideration of US$5.5 million.<ref name=""4R""/><ref name=""7R"">{{cite web|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2010/02/05/government-has-paid-for-the-50-indeni-shares-ps/ |title=Government has paid for the 50% Indeni shares–PS |newspaper=Lusaka Times | date=5 February 2010 |author=Lusaka Times |access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref>

Since then, there have been attempts to bring on-board a strategic partner with funding and expertise to upgrade, modernize and expand the refinery.<ref name=""8R"">{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ozabs-zambia-energy-idAFJOE5A50ET20091106 |title=Zambia Seeks New Partner for Indeni Oil Refinery |publisher=[[Reuters.com]] |date=6 November 2009 | work=Reuters |access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=""9R"">{{cite web|url=http://www.zda.org.zm/?q=content/indeni-oil-refinery-stake-attracts-7-bids-says-zda | title=Indeni Oil Refinery Stake Attracts 7 Bids, Says ZDA |date=2018 | publisher=Zambia Development Agency |access-date=17 May 2020 |

==Modernization==
In 2017, the [[World Bank]] stated that the Indeni Petroleum Refinery was ""inefficient and technologically unsuited for current fuel needs"". Its capacity is too small. It does not produce refinement products that larger, more efficient refineries can. For the amount of resources expended to keep it running, the government can do better towards meeting their national petroleum objectives.<ref name=""11R"">{{cite web|
url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2017/01/26/indeni-refinery-inefficient-technologically-unsuited-current-fuel-needs-world-bank/ |title=Indeni Refinery Is Inefficient And Technologically Unsuited for Current Fuel Needs – World Bank |date=26 January 2017 |newspaper=Lusaka Times |access-date=17 May 2020 | author=Lusaka Times}}</ref>

In order to meet increasing petroleum products demand both nationally and regionally, there are two choices (a) build a new modern refinery that meets current and future national and regional needs or (b) expand and modernize the present refinery to improve its efficiency and output. Building a new refinery is ruled out by its cost. Rehabilitation, expansion and modernization has been estimated at about US$500 million. As the government considers its options, the capacity at the refinery has dropped to 21,000 bbl/day. The last hope is to find a deep-pocket investor who can buy a stake in the present refinery and modernize it.<ref name=""1R""/><ref name=""8R""/><ref name=""9R""/>

'''Lunsemfwa Lower Hydroelectric Power Station''', is a planned {{convert|255|MW|abbr=on}} hydroelectric power station in [[Zambia]]. The power station is under development by a consortium comprising [[Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company]] (LHPC), a Zambian [[independent power producer]] and ''EleQtra'', a United Kingdom-based financial and development company. The off-taker is planned to be [[ZESCO|Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited]] (ZESCO), the national electricity utility [[parastatal]] company.<ref name=""1R"">{{cite web| url=https://www.power-technology.com/marketdata/lunsemfwa-lower-zambia/ |date=9 December 2021 |title=Lunsemfwa Lower, Zambia |
work=Power-Technology.com |access-date=14 August 2022 | author=Carmen |location=New York City}}</ref>

==Location==
The power station would be located across the [[Lunsemfwa River]], in Zambia's [[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]], downstream of the 40 MW Mulungushi Hydroelectric Power Station and the 18 MW Lunsemfwa Hydroelectric Power Station.<ref name=""1R""/>

==Overview==
The design calls for generation capacity of 255 megawatts. the power station is planned as a [[run of river]] project, without a large reservoir. The gross [[hydraulic head]] is planned at {{convert|488|m|0}}. Three penstocks each with diameter of {{convert|2.2|m|ft}} and {{convert|1000|m|0}} long, will carry water to three electric generators, each rated at 85 MW. The 1,630 GWh generated here annually are expected to be purchased by ZESCO for integration into the Zambian national grid.<ref name=""1R""/>

==Developers==
As far back as 2010, Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Company and InfraCo Africa Limited, planned to develop a power station on the Lunsemfwa River. At that time, a 120 MW project was anticipated at a projected cost of between US$220 million and US$275 million.<ref name=""2R"">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ozabs-electricity-zambia-plant-20100603-idAFJOE65208120100603/ | title=Zambia plans to build 120 MW power plant |date=3 June 2010 | work=[[Reuters.com]] |access-date=14 August 2022 |author=Chris Mfula}}</ref> Eleven years later, a 255 MW plant is planned with InfraCo passing the responsibility to her subsidiary EleQtra. The owner remains LHPC.<ref name=""1R""/>

==Cost and timeline==
The cost of construction is reported as approximately US$300 million. Construction is expected to start in 2023 and last approximately three years.<ref name=""1R""/>

Due to the poor health outcomes for mothers, and the challenges to access of care there is a significant impact on the culture of birth. Diversity in language and ethnicity plays a role in the diversity of care throughout Zambia. Establishing safety for the mother and baby through national health improvement, particularly concerning infectious disease and access to clean water, is a priority for Zambia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Safe Mother Safe Babes - Home|url=https://www.safemotherssafebabies.org/|website=SAFE|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref>

Cultural beliefs during pregnancy, values and traditions can significantly affect individuals’ attitudes towards modes of delivery, their definitions of different modes, and the decisions they make in this regard. In order to develop a positive cultural and religious attitude towards vaginal delivery, women's awareness has to be raised through various ways and the existing misconceptions need to be corrected.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Latifnejad Roudsari |first1=Robab |last2=Zakerihamidi |first2=Maryam |last3=Merghati Khoei |first3=Effat |title=Socio-Cultural Beliefs, Values and Traditions Regarding Women's Preferred Mode of Birth in the North of Iran |journal=International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery |date=2015 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=165–176 |pmid=26171405 |pmc=4495324 }}</ref> While the woman is pregnant, extra precaution were taken as it is believed the women and her baby are in a physically and spiritually weaker state; this means they are more susceptible to sickness and evil forces. Preventative measures include changes in the women's nutrition. Certain foods are considered harmful to the fetus and should be avoided by the mother. For example, eating eggs while pregnant will cause the child to be born without hair. Eating fish could cause an infant abnormality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maimbolwa|first1=Margaret C.|last2=Yamba|first2=Bawa|last3=Diwan|first3=Vinod|last4=Ransjo-Arvidson|first4=Anna-Berit|date=August 2003|title=Cultural childbirth practices and beliefs in Zambia|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=263–274|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02709.x|pmid=12859785|issn=0309-2402}}</ref>

Postpartum care isn't widely accessible or accessed, but research has shown that access to antenatal care in preparation for the birth is associated with better postpartum care and contraceptive use.<ref name=do/> Use of postpartum birth control and family planning leads to better maternal health outcomes, including a reduction in the number of pregnancies, reduced transmission of STIs, and overall decreased risk for maternal mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stover|first1=John|last2=Ross|first2=John|date=2010-09-01|title=How Increased Contraceptive Use has Reduced Maternal Mortality|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=687–695|doi=10.1007/s10995-009-0505-y|pmid=19644742|s2cid=24807294|issn=1573-6628}}</ref>

Access to clean drinking water is a major concern in Zambia. 85.6% of the population in urban areas and 51.3% of the population in rural areas as access to improved water sources, and 14.4% of the urban population and 48.7% of the rural population has access to unimproved water sources. Access to sanitation facility access is unimproved in 44.4% of the urban population and 64.3% in the rural population.<ref name=wfb/>

Women are not allowed to have sexual intercourse after the eighth month of pregnancy, this is believed to prevent the baby to have “white stuff” (vernix) on their skin when they are born.<ref name=maimbolwa2003>{{cite journal |last1=Maimbolwa |first1=Margaret C. |last2=Yamba |first2=Bawa |last3=Diwan |first3=Vinod |last4=Ransjo-Arvidson |first4=Anna-Berit |title=Cultural childbirth practices and beliefs in Zambia |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |date=August 2003 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=263–274 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02709.x |pmid=12859785 }}</ref>  Furthermore, extramarital relations are believed to bring harm to the baby.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

There are certain food women are allowed to and are not allowed to eat during pregnancy and labor, as they could have a lasting effect of the child's health. For example, women are not allowed to eat eggs.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

==Labor==
Labor usually takes place in the home of the laboring women, should complications arise they are transferred to a maternity birthing center. However, due to geographic constraints sometime transportation is not an option, these geographic barriers contribute to the poor maternal health outcomes.<ref name=schmidt>Schmidt, C. (2013). Cultural Factors Exacerbating the Tragedy of Maternal Health in Zambia. 2013 NCUR.</ref>
 
Labor is meant to be a private matter between the women and a few support people, the woman will often isolate herself from those not acting as support people during her laboring. Males are also not allowed to be a part of the laboring process.<ref name=schmidt/>

Laboring mothers often behave in ways that conform to societal expectations in terms how a laboring mother should act. For example, it is the belief that mothers should not should not be vocal during the delivery process as it could lead to complications for the baby.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> 
 
Women are encouraged by their mbusa to push whenever they experience pain.  Mbusas will also utilize pieces of clothing called a chitenge to assist women into different positions, in an attempt to alleviate some of their pain.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>
 
Three to four women are allowed to be present during the labor and delivery process. These women are usually relatives or close friends such as: daughters, sisters, nieces, neighbors, and co-wives. Should a woman tell more than a few close relatives and friends she is in labor it is believed that she will become bewitched and complications will occur during the labor process.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> Laboring and mothers giving birth preferred to have someone close by acting as a support person for them, however when naming the person they want to be there, a husband or male support person is usually not named.<ref name=maimbolwa2001>{{cite journal |last1=Maimbolwa |first1=M |last2=Sikazwe |first2=N |last3=Yamba |first3=B |last4=Diwan |first4=V |last5=Ransjö-Arvidson |first5=AB |title=Views on involving a social support person during labor in zambian maternities |journal=Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health |date=August 2001 |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=226–234 |doi=10.1016/s1526-9523(01)00134-9 |pmid=11603634 }}</ref>
 
Mbusas operate under the assumption that less interference during the laboring process is better. However, at times they will employ a variety of strategies to accelerate the labor process. These include: providing fundal pressure, using a cooking stick to provide pressure in their mouth, and physically moving the mother. The gag reflex is used to help speed up either the labor process or the delivery of the placenta.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

==Birth==
Only 5.4% of births in Zambia are attended by a trained traditional birth attendant. Most laboring women will have a social support person present during the antepartum period, however if a woman gives birth in a hospital, the support person will, most likely, not be present during the actual laboring process. These women are called “mbusas”. Mbusas and those providing support during the laboring process have not received any formal education or training surround care of the laboring women. In most cases they do not have the skills needed to handle obstetrical emergencies. In those cases, they choose to accompany the laboring mothers to maternity units rather than delivering in the home.  The major roles of mbusas during the laboring process is to provide emotional support to the mother.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> 
 
When mothers are brought into maternity centers, often do not have any direction making power. Many of the mbusas and those to bring the mothers to the maternity center are often only allowed in the room during visiting hours, however many women will choose to wait outside the unit. Should a mother be able to labor at home most of the power still belongs to them throughout the whole process. Furthermore, women who give birth in a medical center are subjected to more of the “coercive obstetric procedures” these include birthing positions that are convenient for the health care provider but not the laboring women.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=Helen |title=Ethnocentrism: reflections on medical anthropology - Edited by Sjaak Van Der Geest & Ria Reis |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=June 2006 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=481–482 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2006.00303_16.x }}</ref>
 
53% of births occur in the home. The majority of the rest of the birth occur in maternity centers and hospitals. There seems to be a divide between those who gave birth in health care centers as opposed to those who gave at home. This is evidence by the fact that those who gave birth at home, do not receive as much postpartum as those who give birth in a healthcare setting. The women who choose to have a birth at home, states that they feel unwelcome at postpartum care clinics.<ref name=do/>
 
Typically in labors occurring in the home mothers are free to choose a birthing position that is most comfortable to them: some of these positions include, [[sitting]], [[kneeling]], and [[Squatting position|squatting]]. Mbusa will help with positioning through the use of a chitenge, a fabric Zambian women use to tie around the waist. Those laboring in health care centers may not have as much freedom in positioning.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> 
 
Similar to the pain experienced during labor women giving birth are encouraged to push through the pain. Typically, no pharmacological pain relief is given to mothers birthing at home and mbusas will resort to using position changes as a way to relieve some of the mother's pain.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

Once the placenta is delivered it is buried in a specific place near the house or village. It is done this way to protect the mother and her baby from witchcraft.  The placenta also plays a major role in the preservation of the women's fertility. One mbusa states: “The placenta is buried, with the side where the baby lies facing the sky, and leaving the end of the cord showing, so that when the cord drops from the baby it should be connected with the cord buried with the placenta to protect the fertility.”.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

Some women cite the feelings of embarrassment dictating their personal behaviors. In a qualitative study one woman stated: “I would feel shy to have somebody next to me because we make a lot of noise and we are not covered.”. Furthermore, with the presence of a support person women feel that their behaviors must conform strictly with societal norms, as the support person could tell others if she did not.<ref name=maimbolwa2001/>

Should a complication arise women birthing at home do not have the resources of skills to be treated at home, women are transferred to the maternity center if they are able to get there logistically. Societal norms at times can view complications or an unhealthy mother and/or baby as the fault of the mother due to her behaviors during the pregnancy or labor.

Obstetrical technology is not used in home births, this is one of the reason, home births with complications are transferred to a healthcare setting if possible. The use of technology within hospitals is also limited. For example, continuous fetal monitoring does not occur in most maternity centers.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> In hospitals the rate of episiotomies is not documented however it is estimated to be around 28%.<ref name=mackeith>{{cite journal |last1=MacKeith |first1=N. |last2=Chinganya |first2=O. J. M. |last3=Ahmed |first3=Y. |last4=Murray |first4=S. F. |title=Zambian Women's Experiences of Urban Maternity Care: Results from a Community Survey in Lusaka |journal=African Journal of Reproductive Health |date=2003 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=92–102 |doi=10.2307/3583349 |pmid=12828141 |jstor=3583349 |citeseerx=10.1.1.531.5322 }}</ref>

==Postpartum==
Once babies are born they are placed on a delivery mat until the mother delivers the placenta. The umbilical cord is then cut with a razor blade or sugar cane peel. Afterwards both the mother and the baby are bathed.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> Postpartum visits usually take place within the first 6 weeks after the birth of the child.<ref name=mackeith/>

Women who gave birth at home will then recover at home at well. There was no information about the average length of stay after a birth for women who birth in maternity centers.<ref name=Samiya>Samiya-Sumi, (2014). The Ultimate Guide to Postpartum Care: What to Do after Giving Birth | [https://www.theraply.sg/blog/post-pregnancy/the-guide-to-postpartum-care/ Postpartum Care] on September 15, 2014.</ref>

Pregnancy due dates and the start of labor are not announced as many are fearful this could evoke evil witchcraft.

There are no significant differences noticed between women who have given birth before and those who have not, the labor process seems to be approached in the same way.

One third of women who are married also use contraception. Furthermore, on average women begin to use contraception 8 months after their childbirth.<ref name=do/> After a child is born and while they are breastfeeding sexual activity is not allowed, as to protect the child.<ref name=schmidt/>

There is a large divide between those women who live in urban areas and those who live in rural areas in terms of postpartum care. Reports show that the rate of postpartum visits (up to 6 weeks after the birth of the baby) is 84% in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. As opposed to a rate of 42% of women from rural areas went to postpartum care.<ref name=do>{{cite journal |last1=Do |first1=Mai |last2=Hotchkiss |first2=David |title=Relationships between antenatal and postnatal care and post-partum modern contraceptive use: evidence from population surveys in Kenya and Zambia |journal=BMC Health Services Research |date=4 January 2013 |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=6 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-13-6 |pmid=23289547 |pmc=3545900 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Newborn==
Care for the newborn is focused mainly on superstitious issues surrounding the umbilical cord. Women dress the umbilical cord with different mixtures such as ash, seashell with oil, or breastmilk and believe that the cord dropping on the male genitals will lead to infertility.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> It is also believed that a mother should not cook until the umbilical cord has fallen off, or the mother will get a mysterious disease.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> A baby born covered in vernix is considered to be dirty. Babies are traditionally left either unwrapped, or wrapped in piece of cloth immediately after birth.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> Skin-to-skin contact isn't always employed, unless the birth attendants have been trained to do so. These traditions may lead to hypothermia and delayed breast feeding. In hospitals and maternity centers specifically, the mothers were not encouraged to have skin to skin contact immediately following the birth of their child, nor were they encouraged to breastfeed.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

Due to the high maternal mortality rate of 224 deaths per 100,000 live births, many newborns are left without a mother and may therefore be orphaned and sent to an orphanage. Contributing to the high maternal mortality is access to care for mothers in need. Zambia has only 0.17 physicians and 2 hospital beds per 1,000.<ref name=wfb/> Poor maternal outcomes lead to poor newborn outcomes as well, particularly regarding the loss of a primary caregiver. The national rate of infant mortality is the 17th highest in the world at 64.72 per 1,000 live births.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Access to clean water and sanitations is a considerable concern for the health and nutrition of the mother. If mom doesn't have proper nutrition and is breastfeeding, chances are the child will be malnourished as well. In Zambia, 14.9% of children under 5 are underweight.<ref name=wfb/>

In Zambia, 8 out of 10 mothers breastfeeds exclusively for 6 months.<ref name=leach>Leach-Kemon, K. (2015). Visualizing Zambia's success with breastfeeding. Humanosphere. Retrieved from http://www.humanosphere.org/science/2015/04/visualizing-zambias-success-breastfeeding/ on April 9, 2016.</ref> The exclusive rate for breastfeeding of children under 6 months is 61%, and early initiation (within the first hour) occurs in 57% of moms.<ref name=unicef>Unicef.

Movement for baby friendly hospitals, ones that accommodate babies in the rooms with moms, promote breastfeeding, and provide lactation consultant services. Protection from HIV is another reason breastfeeding is encouraged, as exclusive breastfeeding builds the baby's immunity. Prior to the early 2000s, it was believed that HIV+ mothers should not breastfeed to avoid spreading HIV to their baby. When this was proven false and the National AIDS Council published a recommendation for HIV mothers to breastfeed their babies, breastfeeding rates began to rise again around 2007.<ref name=leach/> An advocacy campaign was launched by the Zambian ministry of health in 2009 to promote improvement of exclusive breastfeeding rate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia launches campaign to promote exclusive breastfeeding|url=https://www.unicef.org/doublepublish/zambia_48128.html|website=UNICEF|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref> They have created a video is used to promote breastfeeding. However, as noted earlier, the access to media is limited in Zambia, so alternate methods of dissemination are required. The following graphic represents the increase in coverage of exclusive breastfeeding across Zambia over 5 year increments.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Zambia is one of 22 African countries with the highest burden of undernutrition in children under five, and Micronutrient deficiencies are common in Zambian children, as vitamin A deficiencies are present in 54% of children under 5, and anemia in 53%.<ref name=unicef/> A child's nutritional status is influenced by access to food, care, and health, and poor feeding practices combined with illnesses such as intestinal parasites, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS cause this high burden of undernutrition.<ref name=unicef/> Improving the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in mothers will help to improve the nutritional issues present in children and infants.

Circumcision is generally perceived and suggested to be beneficial for reduction of STI and HIV transmission. Many religious and cultural groups have circumcision as a standard practice, but the medical circumcision movement has expanded as the understanding of the benefits has.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lukobo |first1=M.

The king's title comes from the first recorded Chitimukulu, who was originally named [[Chiti Muluba]], but changed his name to ''Chiti Mukulu'' ({{Literal translation|Chiti the Great}}). In the 18th century, the Bemba came out from their original lands in the [[Luba Empire]] of [[Mukulumpe]] in [[DR Congo]] to eventually settle the country around [[Kasama, Zambia|Kasama]] in Zambia's [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The original Bemba Kings are said to have been descendants of King Mukulumpe and his last wife Mumbi Mukasa who belonged to the Crocodile Clan. Together, they had four children: Katongo, Nkole, Chiti and Chilufya Mulenga. The Bemba were given a kingdom to rule by their father. According to legend, they then built a tower to help them see approaching enemies from a distance, but the tower collapsed, causing several deaths. The Bemba leaders were called by their father to exculpate themselves but in the end, their elder brother was arrested and blinded to send a message to his young brothers. After the Bemba Kings saw the cruelty of their father, they decided to leave and settle where they would find a dead crocodile. After years of wandering in [[Zambia]] the Bemba settled in [[Mungwi District]], having found a dead crocodile. The first Chitimukulu to settle in [[Lubemba]] (Upemba) was Chilufya Mulenga.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Disability in Zambia,"{{Short description|none}}
[[File:Georgina_Mumba.jpg|alt=Georgina Mumba, a disability activist from Zambia, at the University of Arizona 2016.|thumb|300x300px|Georgina Mumba, a disability activist from Zambia, at the University of Arizona 2016.]]People with '''disability in Zambia''' face many unique challenges. The country has been passing laws and policies to help [[Disability|people with disabilities]] in [[Zambia]], however, [[social stigma]] and other factors sometimes interfere in people being able to access services and assistance. In addition, the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV epidemic]] in Zambia also has a significant impact on the lives of people with disabilities.

==Demographics==
As of 2008, it was estimated that around 256,000 in Zambia have a disability in some form and around 5.4% of that number have an [[intellectual disability]].{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=142}} In 2011, it was estimated that the numbers may actually be somewhere between 1 and 2 million people with disability in Zambia.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.osisa.org/law/zambia/dealing-disability|title=Dealing with disability|last=Lee|first=Richard|date=7 August 2013|website=The Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA)|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603073138/http://www.osisa.org/law/zambia/dealing-disability|archive-date=3 June 2017|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref> Sixty percent of Zambians live in rural areas where they have limited access to healthcare.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite news |title=Zambia: Rights Disabled |date=3 January 2005 |work=Women's Feature Service}}</ref> People with disabilities have an employment rate of 45.5%, which is lower than the 58% rate for people without disabilities, according to 2005 statistics.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=1}}

Care-giving roles for people with disabilities in Zambia has shifted to a younger demographic than in previous years.{{Sfn|Chiluba|Moyo|2017|p=6}} This is in part due to the drop in [[life expectancy]] in Zambia.{{Sfn|Chiluba|Moyo|2017|p=6}}

==Cultural attitudes towards disability==
In general, people with disability often face [[social stigma]] in Zambia.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=2}} Zambian people with disability can be thought to be the victims of [[witchcraft]] by others.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/08/06/488665391/the-mis-education-and-remarkable-triumph-of-georgina-mamba|title=The Mis-Education — And Remarkable Triumph — Of Georgina Mumba|last=Aizenman|first=Nurith|date=6 August 2016|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215203703/https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/08/06/488665391/the-mis-education-and-remarkable-triumph-of-georgina-mamba|archive-date=15 February 2017|language=en}}</ref> Modern Zambian religious beliefs have come to accept and embrace individuals with disabilities over time.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=143}} Some Zambians attribute a shift to [[Christianity]] to the new, more positive, views on people with disability in Zambia.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=55}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2015/08/21/disability-and-the-church-breaking-the-silence/|title=Zambia : Disability and the Church: Breaking the Silence|last=Mumba|first=Georgina|date=2015-08-21|work=Lusaka Times|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> In the workplace, individuals still face [[discrimination]].{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=52}}

Relatives are expected to care for individuals who have a disability.{{Sfn|Chiluba|Moyo|2017|p=2}} However, there are boarding schools for children with disabilities, and these are often utilized when the children had been orphaned or abandoned.<ref name="":0"" /> People with disabilities and who are also [[HIV|HIV positive]] are further marginalized by their communities.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=10}} People with disability are often expected to rely on [[Charity (practice)|charity]].<ref name="":3"" />

People with disabilities, especially women and those who are HIV positive are assumed to have no sexuality or sex lives by others in Zambia.{{Sfn|Wickenden|Nixon|Yoshida|2013|p=2}} Disabled women attempting to access health care are often discouraged from visiting health centres, especially for sexual and maternal health needs.<ref name="":2"" />

==Policy==
Disability issues in Zambia fall under the control of the Ministry of Community Development and Social Welfare, now known as the [[Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health]] (MCDMCH).<ref name="":2"" />{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=3}} However, overall, there is a lack of government support for individuals with disabilities.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=53}} Individuals who have an [[intellectual disability]] cannot receive [[Welfare spending|social welfare]] benefits.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=144}} A [[Trust law|trust fund]], managed by the [[Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities]], give out funds to mostly individuals with physical disabilities.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=144}}

Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan has made some progress in helping people with disabilities in Zambia achieve equal status.<ref name="":3"" />

=== Infrastructure ===
Laws requiring ramps for schools and public buildings were passed in 2012.<ref name="":0"" /> However, many of the ramps that have been built are not suitable for people with physical disabilities.<ref name="":0"" /> The largest museum in Zambia, the [[Livingstone Museum]], installed a ramp and other accessibility features in 2006.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=57}}

=== Education ===
The [[Ministry of Education (Zambia)|Ministry of Education]] in Zambia handles [[special education]] in the schools.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}} The Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority (TEVETA) is also involved in both education and employment.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=3}} People with disabilities in Zambia experience difficulty accessing educational opportunities.{{Sfn|Trani|Loeb|2012|p=S32}} Special education services have been very limited in Zambia.<ref name="":0"" /> Parents of children with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] (ID) in [[Lusaka]] reported that there were challenges to meeting the social needs of their young adult children.{{Sfn|Nkhosi|Menon|2015|p=164}}

There have been efforts in Zambia to improve education for people with disabilities. The Persons with Disabilities Act, which mandates that all schools offer inclusive education, was passed by the government in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Persons with disabilities act, 2012.PDF |url=https://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/The%20Persons%20with%20disabilities%20act%2C%202012.PDF}}</ref> The Act also created the Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities, which offers assistance, including educational opportunities, to people with disabilities. Additionally, a number of non-governmental organisations have been working to increase accessibility to education for Zambians with disabilities. For instance, Special Olympics Zambia offers education, health care, sports training, and competitions for kids and adults with intellectual disabilities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/programs/africa/zambia |access-date=2023-02-23 |website=SpecialOlympics.org |language=en}}</ref>

=== Non Governmental Organisations ===
The first organisation focusing on helping people with disabilities, The Northern Rhodesia Society for the Blind, was formed in 1952.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=60}}

The [[Zambia Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities]] (ZACALD) is one of the most prominent organisations to advocate for individuals with intellectual disabilities in Zambia.{{Sfn|Mung'omba|2008|p=144}} The [[Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities]] (ZAPD) works with the government to advise on policy and advocate for people with disabilities.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=3}} In addition, the [[Zambia Federation of Disability Organisations]] (ZAFOD) has been cited by the [[Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa]] (OSISA) as an active and influential organisation in Zambia.<ref name="":3"" /> ZAFOD advocates for [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]] and promotes teaching issues relating to people with disabilities in [[Higher education|tertiary schools]] in the country.<ref name="":3"" />

=== Legislation ===
In 1996, the Zambian government passed the Disability Act of 1996.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=60}} This act bans discrimination based on disability.{{Sfn|Phiri|2010|p=60}} This act was repealed in 2012 and replaced with the Persons with Disability Act of 2012.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}} The new act is meant to implement the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}}

In 1998, the Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Act was passed and a provision considers the needs of people with disability.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}} The Workers' Compensation Act of 1999 changed the law relating to workers' compensation for injuries on the job.{{Sfn|ILO|2013|p=2}}

==Unique challenges==

=== People with disabilities and HIV status ===
Zambia is affected by a generalized [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV epidemic]].{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=51}} Individuals with disabilities face unique challenges in getting access to [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]] and treatment.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|last1=Tun|first1=Waimar|last2=Okal|first2=Jerry|last3=Schenk|first3=Katie|last4=Esantsi|first4=Selina|last5=Mutale|first5=Felix|last6=Kyeremaa|first6=Rita Kusi|last7=Ngirabakunzi|first7=Edson|last8=Asiah|first8=Hilary|last9=McClain-Nhlapo|first9=Charlotte|date=2016-07-01|title=Limited accessibility to HIV services for persons with disabilities living with HIV in Ghana, Uganda and Zambia|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=5 (Suppl 4)|page=20829|doi=10.7448/ias.19.5.20829|pmid=27443266|pmc=4956734|issn=1758-2652}}</ref> There is also a lack of information and education available in formats such as [[Braille]], large print or via [[Sign language|sign-language]] interpreters.<ref name="":1"" /> Children with disabilities also have trouble accessing HIV prevention information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/15/zambia-people-disabilities-left-behind-hiv-response|title=Zambia: People With Disabilities Left Behind in HIV Response|date=2014-07-15|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en}}</ref> In addition, the social stigma of disability and having HIV means that some individuals prefer to die at home rather than receive treatment for HIV.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=1}} People who are both HIV positive and have a disability have reported that ""they were seen as 'other' and 'less than human' by"" health care providers.{{Sfn|Parsons|Bond|Nixon|2015|p=7}} They report ""disability-related stigma that became heightened by the presence of HIV.""{{Sfn|Nixon|Cameron|Hanass-Hancock|Simwaba|2014|p=4}}

Many disabled individuals have reported losing their jobs after discovery of their HIV status has been revealed.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=53}} These individuals turn to begging for money, which is also frowned upon in most Zambian communities.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=53}} Those who do have jobs find that it is difficult to take their HIV medications on time outside of the home.{{Sfn|Njelesani|Nixon|Cameron|Parsons|2015|p=54}}

People with disabilities who are also HIV positive are generally assumed to not be engaging in sexual activity, when in fact, they ""may be equally as sexually active as others and at increased risk of [[sexual abuse]].""{{Sfn|Nixon|Cameron|Hanass-Hancock|Simwaba|2014|p=1}} Assumptions about their sexuality can impact their health.{{Sfn|Wickenden|Nixon|Yoshida|2013|p=7}} They have also had their [[privacy]] disregarded by health care workers who were shocked to discover a person with disabilities who was also HIV positive: ""whenever they find a person with disability who is positive, it becomes a shock to them. They share it with other counsellors, and then it get broken into society.""{{Sfn|Nixon|Cameron|Hanass-Hancock|Simwaba|2014|p=5}}

=== Children with intellectual disabilities ===
Parents of children with [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]] (ID) in Zambia have found that healthcare professionals do not have an ""understanding of their child's condition"" and the effects the condition can have on the caregivers.{{Sfn|Nkhosi|Menon|2015|p=167}}

Eastern Lunda,"The '''Lunda''' people of the [[Luapula River]] valley in [[Zambia]] and [[DR Congo]] are called by others the '''''Eastern Lunda''''' to distinguish them from the [[Lunda people|'western' Lunda people]] who remained in the heartland of the former [[Lunda Kingdom]], but they themselves would use '''''Kazembe-Lunda''''' or '''Luunda''' with an elongated 'u' to make that distinction. (The name 'Lunda' may also be spelled '''Luunda''').

The Eastern Lunda migrated in the 18th century to their current area under the leader [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]. Their neighbours in northern Zambia to whom they are allied, the [[Bemba people|Bemba]], did so at the same time, and the Eastern Lunda took on the [[Bemba language]] in place of the [[Chilunda]], their original language. Their (western) Lunda compatriots in the [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] of Zambia still speak Chilunda however.

Yet due to the processing methods of removing the germ and [[Fruit anatomy|pericarp]], maize is a poor source of protein which often requires supplementation.<ref name="":0"" /> Within the Blouberg Region, Limpopo, there are some 30 species of insect which are considered edible, and of those, the caterpillar ''[[Hemijana variegata]]'' Rothschild ([[Lepidoptera]]: [[Eupterotidae]]) is considered a delicacy while being nutritionally sound.<ref name="":0"" /> Depending on how it is prepared, the nutritional values of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and essential vitamins varies. According to B.A. Egan et al. (2014) the fortification of staple cereals with insects would positively affect the protein content of the community's diet, and should be promoted as a healthy alternative to beef.<ref name="":0"" />

==== Traditional preparation ====
''[[Hemijana variegata]]'' Rothschild are sold in local markets in the village of Ga Manaka. In this market, the caterpillars are collected by locals in the surrounding forests near [[Blouberg (range)|Blouberg Mountain]] and transported back for preparation. Local residents report it was important to wash them after collection. They would wash them three times and purge them, before boiling them in salty water for an hour. They are then sun dried until brittle and the hairs are ""shaken off by '[[winnowing]]' in a basket or bucket.""<ref name="":0"" />

==== Nutrition ====
The ''[[Hemijana variegata]]'' has protein content that exceeds that of more common livestock such as cows or chickens when measured per gram.<ref name="":0"" /> The energy, and protein content of the caterpillars which had been traditionally dried had been lower than that of oven based drying.<ref name="":0"" /> The energy content of the caterpillars (552&nbsp;[[kcal]]/100&nbsp;g.) is greater than that of beef (112 to 115&nbsp;kcal/100&nbsp;g), goat meat (96.36 and 101.47&nbsp;kcal/100&nbsp;g), and chicken (144&nbsp;kcal/100&nbsp;g).<ref name="":0"" /> The fat content is 20% which is higher than [[beef]] or [[chicken]].<ref name="":0"" /> The [[vitamin C]] content was measured at (14.15&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g.) compared to (30&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g) in [[pea]]s and over (90&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g) in [[broccoli]].<ref name="":0"" />

===Venda, South Africa ===
Caterpillars such as ''[[Gonimbrasia belina]]'', or mopane, are a staple protein source for the communities of the Northern Province of [[South Africa]] (formerly [[Venda]]).<ref name="":1"" /> Caterpillars are one of the many insects that are traded in wide reaching markets (southern [[Zimbabwe]], eastern [[Botswana]] and northern provinces of [[South Africa]], formerly known as [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]]); not only are caterpillars traded in this expansive market, but other species traded include: soldier [[termite]]s (''[[Macrotermes]]'': [[Termitidae]], [[Termite|Isoptera]]), green bugs (''[[Tessaratomidae|Encosternum]]'': [[Tessaratomidae]], [[Hemiptera]]) and flying termites ([[Termite|Isoptera]]).<ref name="":1"" /> Within rural communities still practicing traditional diets, grasshoppers and mopane worms are considered vital in their subsistence economy and the most important insects for nutrition.<ref name="":1"" /> The amount of caught insects per time spent trapping varies, depending on the level of rainfall predominately, but also different environmental conditions.<ref name="":1"" /> Within rural communities grasshoppers and locusts are often trapped for personal consumption rather than to be sold within a market.<ref name="":1"" />

In the 1996 survey of the community upwards of 70% of rural households reported having consumed grasshoppers regularly, having an estimated daily intake of 14 [[gram]]s.<ref name="":1"" /> The practice of collecting grasshoppers for consumption is considered a common activity for young boys and girls, as well as older women, yet not for older men.<ref name="":1"" /> Grasshoppers are a free source of nutritional food and as such are important for the sustenance of communities marginal to market economies; as much as 2350 tons of grasshoppers were estimated to be harvested over a period of eight months.<ref name="":1"" />

==== Language and description ====
Within the Venda language, [[Venda language|Tshivenda]], in general locusts and grasshoppers share a name, ''nzie''. The stages of the insects life also are distinctly named: nymphs as ''vhulka'', and the pre-adult stages: ''thathakubi'' or ''dengulamukumbi''.<ref name="":1"" /> Researchers had documented approximately 155 [[vernacular]] names for varieties of grasshoppers which varied based on the local communities queried, of which most of the respondents were children.<ref name="":1"" /> Overall, the vernacular names represented 42 [[species]] of grasshoppers.<ref name="":1"" /> There are vivid linguistic descriptors of many varied species of grasshopper, based on appearance, behaviors, habits, location found, or the sound made.<ref name="":1"" />

====Medicinal uses ====
[[Grasshopper]]s, or ''bapu'', are used for a variety of ailments, and different preparations have different [[Medicine|medicinal]] properties according to the [[ethnomedicine]] of the communities studied. Some examples are: when ''bapu'' is fried, it is to be eaten as a treatment for young children who wet the bed; when ''bapu'' is dried and ground up and put in warm water it is used to treat nightmares; boiled ''bapu'' is for hyperactive children; ground and then burnt ''bapu'' mixed with [[petroleum jelly]] is applied to the fontanel of newborns to strengthen them; the ashes of roasted ''bapu'' is rubbed onto women's breasts to alleviate pain.<ref name="":1"" />

==== Beliefs ====
Some species of grasshopper are for various reasons thought of to be inedible or dangerous. Besides being inedible, there are beliefs associated with the consumption of certain grasshoppers, such as those that are attracted to fire, which may lead to madness or the loss of one's hearing.<ref name="":1"" /> Losing one's sanity is a persistent fear associated with eating grasshoppers that live near one's house.<ref name="":1"" /> Other such forbidden species are ''silivhindi'' and ''banzi'' ([[Pyrgomorphidae|Pyrgomorphldae]]) which have a distinctly bad odor and are thought to be toxic to both humans and dogs.<ref name="":1"" /> Within Zionist African Churches, many insects such as grasshoppers and locusts are thought of us unclean, and this translates into a stigma against eating those for fear of association.<ref name="":1"" />

Several species are believed to become a [[snake]] if certain practices are not followed. For instance, ''mutotombudzi'' (''[[Acrida]]'' spp., ''[[Truxalis]]'' spp.) requires that you remove the antenna, or ''nzie-luvhele'' (''[[Cyrtacanthacris|Cyrtacanthracris fatarica]]'') must be squashed in a specific manner.<ref name="":1"" /> The folklore associated with ''nyammbeulwana'' is that it could cause one to lose their hair or blood if it were to land on your head.<ref name="":1"" /> Because of the belief that ''tshikwandavhokopfu'' (""powder eater"") often eats human and cow feces some do not eat it.<ref name="":1"" /> Other species have foul tastes or are associated with snakes which often leads to their not being eaten.

===Zambia===
====Bisa people====
The Bisa people inhabit the [[Kopanong Local Municipality|Kopa]] area of [[Mpika District|Mpika]] district of northern [[Zambia]] ([[latitude]], 11° 00'–13° 30' south; [[longitude]], 29° 45'–32° 30' east).<ref name="":2"" />  These people practice traditional [[subsistence farming]], [[hunting]] and caterpillar collection, which is essential to their culture. K.J. Mbata, et al. (2002) conducted a household survey in 2000 to better understand their customs and knowledge concerning caterpillar harvesting. Upwards of 89.1% of respondents practiced caterpillar harvesting in the surrounding [[miombo woodlands]].<ref name="":2"" />  The two most well-known species for harvesting in this region of the eight said to live there were ''[[Gynanisa maja]]'' Strand (''chipumi'') and ''[[Gonimbrasia]] zambesina'' Walker (''mumpa''). Mostly due to their size, flavor, common lack of thorns or [[urticating hair]]s, and their market value, ''[[Gynanisa maja]]'' is the most popular.<ref name="":2"" />  The Bisa people believe that the caterpillars have been with them since time immemorial, as gifts from god, and this respectful belief has helped them formulate sustainable traditional management systems.<ref name="":2"" />

=====Traditional ecological knowledge=====
The [[traditional ecological knowledge]] of the life cycles and harvesting practices have been taught through oral education and shared experiences over centuries, developed in interaction with their local environment. The Bisa identify caterpillar species in various ways, among them the sound that the caterpillars make while eating and on which plants they feed.<ref name="":2"" />  They have an understanding of the life cycles of the harvested caterpillars, recognizing the stages: [[egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and then [[adult]]. Through early September to late October the caterpillars [[oviposit]], and then harvesting is done during the rainy season between November and April.<ref name="":2"" />  [[Taboo]]s and specific seasonal management for harvest are some regulatory mechanisms practiced by the Bisa to teach proper traditional hunting behavior, to protect the maturation process and life cycle of the caterpillar, and to ensure the sustainability of the caterpillar and health of the ecosystem.<ref name="":2"" />

Traditional [[technologies]] protect the habitat of the caterpillars, such as the use of fire to prevent natural blazes from consuming the host trees.<ref name="":2"" />

===== Ritual and beliefs =====
The monitoring process of the Bisa people of the caterpillars are often reproduced and learned through [[ritual]] behavior, performed by members of the senior chief kopa royal establishment.<ref name="":2"" />  These rituals act as a regulator for the harvesting of the caterpillar and involve many layers of the community. The village scouts will walk through the woodlands daily and will report the location of [[egg]]s within their [[chiefdom]] back to the senior chief of the chiefdom. In one such practiced ritual to thank the ancestral Bisa spirits for the edible caterpillars, the senior chief's assistant (''chilukuta'') places a white cloth in the shrine for the burial site of the senior chiefs (''chaipinda'').<ref name="":2"" /> The white cloth is cut into two parts, half of it is to stay at the shrine while the other is cut into smaller pieces. Believed to bless the developing caterpillars, the smaller pieces are used by the chief's male grandchildren to mark the [[host plant]]s.<ref name="":2"" />

As the eggs begin to hatch, the monitors will gather several to present to the chief who will convene a meeting of himself, his adviser and sub-chiefs, and his senior wife.<ref name="":2"" />  The chief's wife (''mukolo-wa-chalo'' or ""mother-of-the-land""), will offer the young caterpillars to the ancestral Bisa spirits at the [[shrine]] (''babenye'') in a ritual known locally as ''Ukuposela.<ref name="":2"" />''  Once the caterpillars have begun reaching [[Adult|maturity]] and samples have been brought by monitors to the senior chief, another meeting is called and more caterpillars are offered up by the senior wife, who following the offering eats the caterpillars that were not offered.<ref name="":2"" />  A third meeting is called to set up a harvesting date in which the wife does not participate, though representatives from buyers outside the chiefdom may be invited. In another meeting a price is set for caterpillar harvests, and no outside representative participates.<ref name="":2"" />

The Bisa people have established rules and taboos for harvesting, such as a stoppage directive issued by the senior chief.<ref name="":2"" />  The signal for the beginning of harvesting generally is the beginning of November and the signal to stop given around mid-December.<ref name="":2"" />  Other taboos and associated beliefs are: collecting caterpillars before or after the signals are believed to lead to those involved getting lost, its forbidden to roast them in an open fire or [[Disembowelment|eviscerate]] them with a knife, noisy or sexual behavior is forbidden while harvesting, and consuming young caterpillars would make people go [[Insanity|insane]].<ref name="":2"" />

'''Jenkem''' is a purported [[inhalant]] and [[hallucinogen]] created from fermented [[human waste]]. In the mid-1990s, it was reported to be a popular [[street drug]] among [[Zambia]]n youth, created by placing feces and urine in a bottle or a bucket, sealing it with a balloon or lid and leaving it to ferment in the sun; afterwards they would inhale the gases generated.<ref name=Donaldson>Donaldson, Aidan (2010).

==Description==
The name derives from Genkem, a brand of glues which had ""become the generic name for all the glues used by [[Inhalant abuse|glue-sniffing]] children"" in South Africa, where the drug originated and is most popular on the African continent today.<ref name=cassere2010>Cassere, Di (November 14, 2000).

They tap the bottles on the ground, taking care to leave enough room for [[methane]] to form at the top.""<ref name=BBC/>

The effects of jenkem inhalation supposedly last for around an hour and consist of auditory and visual [[hallucinations]] for some users.<ref name=BBC/> In 1995, one user told a reporter it is ""more potent than [[cannabis]].""<ref name=IPS>{{cite news |title=Zambia-Narcotics: 'Huffing and Puffing' to a new High |publisher=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=August 26, 1995}} (reprinted in a Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/jenkem.asp article on jenkem], retrieved December 30, 2007.)</ref> A 1999 report interviewed a user, who said, ""With glue, I just hear voices in my head. But with jenkem, I see visions. I see my mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life.""<ref name=BBC/> Fumito Ichinose, an anesthesia specialist from Boston who conducted a study on the effects of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas, or ""sewer gas,"" on mice, informed [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] that holding one's breath, choking, or ""the inhalation of gases like those produced from jenkem could result in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], a lack of oxygen flow to the body that could be alternately euphoric and physically dangerous.""<ref name=Salon/>

===1995–2006===
The second media description of jenkem came from an [[Inter Press Service]] wire report in 1995.<ref name=IPS/> According to a 1998 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fountain of Hope, a [[non-profit organization]], said that jenkem was used by [[street children]] in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], to obtain a ""powerful high"".<ref>{{cite news |first=Suzanne |last=Daley |title=In Zambia, the Abandoned Generation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/18/world/in-zambia-the-abandoned-generation.html?pagewanted=2 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 18, 1998 |access-date=March 11, 2015}} (Spelled ''Jekem'')</ref> In 2002, Project Concern International Zambia and Fountain of Hope released a report entitled ""Rapid Assessment of Street Children In Lusaka"", where jenkem is listed as the third most popular drug among Lusaka's street children, following [[Cannabis sativa|Dagga]] (Cannabis) and ""glue and Dagga"" but ahead of ""Ballan"" (uncured tobacco) and [[Gasoline|petrol]].<ref>{{Cite journal

John C. Zulu, director of the Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development in Zambia, said in November 2007 that jenkem usage is less common than [[glue-sniffing]] and, ""Initially, they used to get it from the sewer, but they make it anywhere ... They say it keeps them warm and makes them fearless.""<ref name=Salon/> In 1999, [[BBC News]] ran a story about jenkem.<ref name=BBC/> In 2004, South African weekly investigative newspaper ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' mentioned jenkem abuse in a report on Zambia's street children.<ref>{{cite news |first=Zarina |last=Geloo |title=Bleak outlook for Zambia's street kids |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2004-12-29-bleak-outlook-for-zambias-street-kids |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 24, 2004 |access-date=March 11, 2015 |quote=Marijuana was used most commonly, along with glue for sniffing, jenkem (fermented sewage), petrol and cocaine.

'''Kazembe''' is a traditional kingdom in modern-day [[Zambia]], and southeastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. For more than 250 years, Kazembe has been an influential kingdom of the [[Luba-Katanga language|Kiluba]]-[[Bemba language|Chibemba]], speaking the language of the Eastern [[Luba people|Luba]]-[[Lunda people|Lunda]] people of south-central Africa<ref name=""Gordon"">{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0021853705001283|author=David M. Gordon|title=History on the Luapula Retold: Landscape, Memory and Identity in the Kazembe Kingdom|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=47|pages=21|year=2006}}</ref> (also known as the Luba, Luunda, Eastern Luba-Lunda, and Luba-Lunda-Kazembe). Its position on trade routes in a well-watered, relatively fertile and well-populated area of forestry, fishery and agricultural resources<ref name=""Gordon""/> drew expeditions by traders and explorers (such as Scottish missionary [[David Livingstone]]<ref name=""Livingstone"">[[David Livingstone]] and [[Horace Waller (activist)|Horace Waller]] (ed.) (1874) ''The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death''. Two volumes, John Murray.</ref>) who called it variously Kasembe, Cazembe and Casembe.

Known by the title Mwata Yav now equivalent to 'Paramount Chief'or King, the monarchy with its annual [[Mtomboko ceremony|Mutomboko festival]] stands out in the [[Luapula]] Valley and [[Lake Mweru]] in present-day [[Zambia]], though its history in colonial times is an example of how Europeans divided traditional kingdoms and tribes without regard to the consequences.

Around 1740 the first Mwata, Ng'anga Bilonda of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba]]-[[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda Kingdom]] headed by [[Mwata Yamvo]] (or 'Mwaant Yav') 300&nbsp;km west of the Luapula in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], left with a group of followers in pursuit eastwards of one Mutanda who had murdered his father Chinyanta and uncle by drowning them in the Mukelweji River.<ref name=""Gordon""/> 'Mwata' was originally a title equivalent to 'General', the first of the Mwata Kazembe line were warriors.<ref name=""Livingstone""/>

After Mutanda had been dealt with, the group continued the eastward migration under Mwata Kazembe II Kanyembo Mpemba, crossing the Luapula River at Matanda, conquering the indigenous people known as the Shila in the Luapula Valley, and setting up Luba or Lunda aristocrats as chiefs over them.<ref name=""chiefsofzambia"">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626071851/http://www.chiefsofzambia.homestead.com/mutomboko.html THE MUTOMBOKO CEREMONY]. Chiefs of Zambia.</ref> Though bringing Lunda and [[Luba people|Luba]] customs and culture (such as the Luba style of ceremonial chieftainship), they adopted the language of the [[Luba-Bemba people|Bemba]], a tribe that had also migrated from the Congo and to which they were allied.<ref name=""Gordon""/>

The kingdom prospered from the fisheries of [[Lake Mweru]] and the [[Mofwe Lagoon]], and natural resources, including copper ore in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], west of the Luapula.<ref name=""Gordonc"">David Gordon (2000) “Decentralized Despots or Contingent Chiefs: Comparing Colonial Chiefs in Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo.” KwaZulu-Natal History and African Studies Seminar, University of Natal, Durban.</ref> Mwata Kazembe was said by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] to be able to raise a force of 20,000 men, and his lands stretched west to the [[Lualaba River]] (the border with Mwata Yamvo's western Luba-Lunda kingdom and with the other Luba's kingdoms north of that) and east to the [[Luba-Bemba people|Luba-Bemba]] country.<ref name=""Livingstone""/> (See the map below.)

In addition to trading with the interior, the Portuguese hoped to establish a route through it connecting their territories of [[Angola]] in the west and [[Mozambique]] in the east.<ref name=""Gordonb"">{{cite journal|author=David M. Gordon|title=Review of Giacomo Macola.

[[Image:Kazembe Kingdom 433x455.JPG|right|thumb|The Kazembe kingdom in its prime in the first half of the 19th Century.]]

The expeditions were:<ref name=""EB"">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cazembe}}</ref>
* 1796 Manuel Caetano Pereira, a [[merchant]].
* 1798 [[Francisco de Lacerda|Francisco José de Lacerda e Almeida]] who came via Tete and died within a few weeks of arriving at Kazembe's, still waiting for trade negotiations to start. He left a valuable journal which was carried back to [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] by his chaplain, Father Pinto, and which was later translated into English by the explorer [[Sir Richard Burton]].
* 1802 Pedro João Baptista and Amaro José, ''[[pombeiros]]'' (slave traders).
* 1831 Major José Monteiro and António Gamito, with 20 [[soldiers]] and 120 slaves as [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], sent from [[Vila de Sena|Sena]] by the Portuguese governor of that district. Gamito also wrote a journal and said, ""We certainly never expected to find so much ceremonial, pomp, and ostentation in the potentate of a region so remote from the sea coast.""<ref name=""Simbao""/>

As trade missions, though, they were all failures. Mwata Kazembe III Lukwesa Ilunga and IV Kanyembo Keleka Mayi rebuffed Portuguese attempts to set up the alliance which would control the [[Atlantic]]-Indian Ocean trade route from beginning to end.<ref name=""EB""/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Ian Cunnison|title=Kazembe and the Portuguese 1798–1832|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=2|pages=61|doi=10.1017/S0021853700002140 |year=2009}}</ref> (The [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] and [[Msiri]] later took control of that route, with Msiri rather than Kazembe as the [[linchpin]].)

====David Livingstone's visit====
In 1867 the explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] embarked on his last expedition in Africa, one aim of which was to discover the southern extent of the [[Nile]] basin (i.e. resolving whether [[Lake Victoria]] truly was the source of the Nile or whether some other lake further south was the source). From 'Nyasaland' ([[Malawi]]) and past the southern tip of [[Lake Tanganyika]], through country ravaged by the slave trade, he reached the northeastern shore of Lake Mweru. He continued south down the eastern shore. Mwata Kazembe VII had been alerted to his arrival and received him at his capital which was then at [[Kanyembo]] near the northeast tip of the Mofwe Lagoon:<ref name=""Livingstone""/>
<blockquote>
“The court or compound of Casembe—some would call it a palace—is a square enclosure of 300 yards by 200 yards. It is surrounded by a hedge of high reeds. Inside, where Casembe honoured me with a grand reception, stands a gigantic hut for Casembe, and a score of small huts for domestics. The Queen's hut stands behind that of the chief, with a number of small huts also ...  Kasembe sat before his hut on an equate seat placed on lion and leopard skins. He was clothed in a coarse blue and white Manchester print edged with red baize, and arranged in large folds so as to look like a crinoline put on wrong side foremost. His arms, legs and head were covered with sleeves, leggings and cap made of various coloured beads in neat patterns: a crown of yellow feathers surmounted his cap ...  He then assured me that I was welcome to his country, to go where I liked, and do what I chose. We then went (two boys carrying his train behind him) to an inner apartment, where the articles of my present were exhibited in detail

Livingstone noted that Mwata Kazembe VII's administration was harsh: A common punishment for court officials was to have the ears cropped by shears. Owing to such tyranny, he would have difficulty raising a thousand men. He observed that the kingdom was not now as prosperous as the Portuguese had reported. The next year he again visited Mwata, who was the first to tell him that the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]], [[Lake Bangweulu]], the Luapula, Lake Mweru and the [[Luvua River|Luvua]]-[[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] were all one system. This sent Livingstone exploring Bangweulu, then the Lualaba which he thought may flow into the Nile, and Tanganyika, then back to Bangweulu and his death five years later, still trying to discover how its rivers link up and for any evidence that it was part of the Nile rather than the [[Congo Basin]].<ref name=""Livingstone""/>

====Arab and Swahili traders====

|}
In the 18th and 19th centuries Arab and Swahili traders visited Mwata Kazembe to trade in copper, ivory and slaves. Trade routes such as that from [[Zanzibar]] via [[Ujiji]] on [[Lake Tanganyika]] were well established, and the Sultan of Zanzibar's name carried weight. Livingstone was held up southeast of Lake Tanganyika by a conflict between [[Tippu Tip]] (Ahmed bin Mohamed, whom Livingstone called Tipo Tipo) and a local chief. When he reached Mwata Kazembe's he found a trader named Mohamad Bogharib had arrived a few days before seeking ivory, and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as Mpamari), a trader who had been there for ten years, as Mwata had refused to let him leave. Despite their involvement in the slave trade, Livingstone travelled with and was helped by them; he claimed to have used his influence to get Mohamed bin Saleh released.<ref name=""Livingstone""/>

In 1856, [[Msiri]] travelled through Kazembe with a band of followers and requested permission from King Chinyanta Munona to settle among Kazembe's tributary of [[Garanganze|Garanganza]] (Katanga). Throughout the 1860s, Kazembe's copper and [[ivory trade]] was usurped by Msiri,<ref name=""Gordon""/> growing his power with the help of local traders and their descendents, known as ''bayeke.'' With the help of the ''bayeke,'' Msiri rebelled against the chief of Garanganza and established the [[Yeke Kingdom]]. Utilizing gunpowder weapons, Msiri rapidly expanded through former Kazembe territory, carving a large territory for himself and reducing the Kazembe to a small state along [[Lake Bangweulu|Lake Bangwelu]], which he held sway over until his death in 1890.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Reefe |first=Thomas |title=The Rainbow and the Kings |year=1981 |isbn=9780520334908}}</ref>

===Colonial history===

====Division between British and Belgian territories====
After Msiri's death, the Luapula valley was divided in 1894 between Britain – the eastern shores of the Luapula and Lake Mweru became part of [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]], administered by the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) – and King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s misnamed [[Congo Free State]] (CFS), or rather its agent, the Compagnie du Katanga, which took over the western shores. The Belgian colonial authorities, having killed Msiri were left with a vacuum. They appointed chiefs – not ones chosen from Msiri's subordinate chiefs (who had previously been subordinate to Mwata Kazembe) – but from what the Luba-Lunda called the 'owners of the land' who had preceded them;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ian Cunnison|title=The Luapula Peoples of Northern Rhodesia: Custom and History in Tribal Politics|journal=Science|volume=133|issue=3455|pages=751|doi=10.1126/science.133.3455.751-a |year=1961}}</ref> there was considerable instability in that part of Katanga as a result. “Belgian administration in Mweru-Luapula was glossed over by a thin veneer of traditional justifications.”<ref name=""Gordonc""/> This included ‘creating’ a tribe from what was a clan, the Bena Ngoma.

Once Belgian colonial rule was established west of the Luapula, Mwata Kazembe's rule and territory, though not his influence, was confined to the eastern side.

====British rule imposed by force====
Although Mwata Kazembe X had signed a BSAC mineral concession and a British treaty brought to him by [[Alfred Sharpe]] in 1890, and allowed visits by British missionary pioneer [[Dan Crawford (missionary)|Dan Crawford]], when the BSAC tax collector [[Blair Watson]] took up residence on the [[Kalungwishi River]] in 1897, Mwata Kazembe refused to let the British flag be flown over his territory or taxes to be collected from his people, and he defeated an armed incursion by Watson's forces.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

Sharpe by now was governor of the [[British Central Africa Protectorate]] ([[Nyasaland]]), 1000&nbsp;km away. It was he who had failed to secure Msiri's [[Garanganze|Garanganza]] kingdom as a British [[Protectorate]] by negotiation, and had later seen it taken from under British noses by the rival CFS through force. In 1899, in conjunction with [[Robert Edward Codrington|Robert Codrington]], acting BSAC Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia, Sharpe sent British officers with [[Sikh]] and Nyasaland troops who burnt Mwata Kazembe's capital to the ground, killing a number of his people, though Mwata himself had already escaped across the Luapula.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

Mwata Kazembe X made his way south and crossed back over the river to take refuge in the [[Mambilima Falls|Johnston Falls Mission]] run by a Mr and Mrs Anderson of [[Dan Crawford (missionary)|Dan Crawford]]'s missionary society. (Ironically, two years before, Mwata Kazembe X had tried to have the Andersons' predecessor at Mambilima, H. J. Pomeroy, killed, but failed.<ref name=""nrzam.org.uk"">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V1N3/V1N3.htm |journal=[[Northern Rhodesia Journal]] |author= William Lammond|title=Fifty Years in Central Africa|volume=1|issue= 3|pages=3–7 |year=1951}}</ref><ref name=""DACBL"">J.

Dan Crawford and Alfred Sharpe had been involved in a similar situation in 1890–91 with [[Msiri]] (see that article). At that time Crawford's superior, Charles Swan, had encouraged Msiri to resist Sharpe's British treaty. A year later Msiri was killed by the Belgians, and the region was plunged into chaos. Now, the Andersons responded to Swan differently. While Mr Anderson kept Mwata Kazembe's men at Mambilima, Mrs Anderson took Mwata Kazembe alone to the British officers back at his burnt capital, saying ""please be kind to him"".<ref name=""nrzam.org.uk""/> Disarmed by this approach and the Mwata's agreement to accept their rule, the British agreed to let him come back.

Mwata Kazembe X rebuilt his capital at [[Kazembe (Mwansabombwe)|Mwansabombwe]]. The British troops took a number of old and valuable works of art of [[Luba people|Luba]] origin from the court, which they gave to Codrington{{Citation Needed|date=August 2022}}. In 1920 his heirs placed them in the National Museum of [[Southern Rhodesia]] in [[Bulawayo]], 1000&nbsp;km away, where they were listed as the 'Codrington Collection'.<ref name=""NRJV3N6"">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/Site%20Resources/NRJ/V3N1/044.jpg |journal=Northern Rhodesia Journal|title=Robert Edward Codrington 1869–1908|volume= 3 |issue=6|year=1956}}</ref><ref>Neville Jones (1930s).

After the [[punitive expedition]], Mwata Kazembe X and his successors worked with the BSAC and its successors, the British District Commissioners, and to some extent it rescued his chieftainship. The Mwata Kazembes had some influence in the colonial era because the British colonial administration ruled indirectly through chiefs.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

====The coming of missionaries====
With Dan Crawford's influence Mwata Kazembe X readily agreed to requests to establish missions in the valley, especially from the [[Plymouth Brethren|Christian Missions in Many Lands]] and the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) which had sent Livingstone to Africa. In 1900 the LMS [[Mbereshi]] Mission was established 10&nbsp;km from Mwansabombwe.<ref name=""Chuba"">Bwalya S Chuba (2000) ''Mbeleshi in a history of the London Missionary Society'', Pula Press.</ref> Here schools, a church and a hospital were established, and brick makers and builders were trained, resulting in the Luapula valley enjoying a higher standard of sun-dried and burnt brick house construction than elsewhere in the region. Other Protestant and Catholic missions established schools and hospitals in the Luapula Valley and on the lake.<ref name=""Chuba""/>

Though by the mid-20th century Mwata Kazembe's realm had become overshadowed by the copper mines and industry of Elisabethville ([[Lubumbashi]]) and the [[Copperbelt]], through their education gained mostly in mission schools, many Luba-Lunda-Kazembe people made their mark in those towns and in [[Lusaka]], and their experience and influence there flowed back the other way.<ref name=""Chuba""/>

Following the [[Luba Empire|Luba]] kingdom model, Mwata Kazembe as the king has senior chiefs under him, and subordinate chiefs and village headmen under them. The Senior Chiefs are Lukwesa, Kashiba, Kambwali and Kanyembo. Mwata appoints these chiefs from his family and, upon his death, one of these senior chiefs may be promoted to the paramount position. There are also chiefs in neighbouring districts who pay tribute to Mwata Kazembe.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

Also following Luba custom, Mwata Kazembe ruled through a council which in colonial times became a 'Superior Native Authority', named in this case the Lunda Native Authority (LNA) to which he appointed a 'cabinet' of advisers who meet under his chairmanship. The LNA was the largest and dominant native authority in the Luapula-Mweru valley. Its work had to be reported to the British District Commissioners who preferred to base themselves in the climate and environment of Kawambwa on the plateau rather than in the heat and mosquitoes of the valley where most of the population lived. It took up a whole day just for quick visit and, in the absence of problems, this allowed the Kazembe chieftainship considerable autonomy.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

====Functions of the kingdom====
Essentially the functions of the kingdom are in the realm of local government, with a stronger emphasis on cultural, social and historical aspects of the life of Kazembe people wherever they may live. The Mwata and his council make regulations in areas not covered by national law or provincial regulations, of land and resource use and management, buildings and infrastructure, employment and occupations, trade and markets, hygiene and health, and traditions and customs including traditional marriage and family life. The Mwata has messengers and guards to enforce regulations, and operates a traditional court to try transgressors; he is also involved in the resolution of disputes.

The Belgian Congo copper-mining town of [[Lubumbashi|Elisabethville]] developed faster than the Northern Rhodesian [[Copperbelt]]. Cut off by the [[Congo Pedicle]], the [[Luapula Province]] was regarded as a backwater by the Northern Rhodesian government in the first part of the 20th century, so that at first Elisabethville was the most accessible city for the Kazembe, connected as it was by road to the Congolese port of [[Kasenga]] on the Luapula, and by boat from there up the river to Lake Mweru. There was migration from the British-administered side to the Belgian one.<ref name=""Gordonc""/> For further details, see the articles on the [[Congo Pedicle]] and [[Congo Pedicle road]].

Mwata Kazembe XIV Shadreck Chinyanta Nankula in the 1940s did much to change this situation. He developed the kingdom and the district, and has been called the first ""modernizing"" Mwata.<ref name=""Gordonb""/> He had been educated and employed in Elizabethville and spoke fluent French and English. He galvanised the LNA, changing its name to the Lunda National Association, and appointing to it people with an energy for change and development, like himself. The District Commissioner worried that some of these, such as [[Dauti Yamba]] were nationalists who might stir up trouble against the colonial administration, but relationships remained workable.<ref name=""Gordonc""/> Mwata Kazembe XIV encouraged the building of schools and clinics in Mwansabombwe and the expansion of missions such as Mbereshi. He wrote an account of the chieftainship which was edited by a White Father missionary, Edouard Labreque,<ref name=""Chuba""/> and finally published in Chibemba as ''Ifikolwe Fyandi na Bantu Bandi'' (My Ancestors and My People)<ref name=""Gordon""/> built the current two-storey Mwata's residence but died two days before it was complete.<ref name=""chiefsofzambia""/>

In the early 1950s, some problems were created across the Luapula when the Luba-Lunda there noted that Mwata Kazembe's courts dispensed justice more to their liking than the Belgians and their chiefs, and asked to be tried for transgressions by the Mwata's courts on the grounds that as Lunda, they had that right, and the local chiefs did not have the authority. But this was not granted.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

The modernising of the kingdom was matched by an increase in prosperity as the Pedicle road connected the Luapula Province to the Copperbelt, and fish and labour flowed more easily to that market.

In 1964 Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia. For a time, chiefs saw their influence overshadowed by party politics and the civil administrations, though in 1985 Mwata Kazembe XVIII was appointed District Commissioner in [[Kawambwa]] and later, Provincial Political Secretary.<ref name=""Cancel"">{{cite journal|author=Robert Cancel|title=Asserting/inventing traditions on the Luapula: the Mutomboko Festival|journal=African Arts|volume=39|issue=3|pages=12|doi=10.1162/afar.2006.39.3.12 |year=2006}}</ref>

The fish and labour economic booms in the forties, fifties and sixties gave way to recessions and stagnation from the mid-seventies onwards as fish catches declined, Copperbelt employment contracted and national problems had an effect. However, the construction in the late sixties of the 'Zambia Way', a road connecting [[Mansa, Zambia|Mansa]] to [[Nchelenge]]-[[Kashikishi]] through Mwansabombwe, and its surfacing and linking to Kawambwa, [[Samfya]] and [[Serenje]] over the next two decades, has funnelled trade through Mwansabombwe, the population of which has risen to around 50,000.<ref name=""Cancel""/>

The Mwata Kazembe chieftainship has endured and though originating in war and being surrounded by countries that have experienced much conflict, it has presided over peace on the eastern shores of the Luapula and Lake Mweru for more than a century.

==Mutomboko Festival==
[[File:Mwata Kazembe at Mtomboko 2017 02.webp|thumb|300x300px|Mwata Kazembe at Mtomboko 2017]]
In the last two decades the Mwata Kazembe chieftainship has experienced something of a cultural if not an administrative or economic resurgence, through the Mutomboko Festival, now the second largest of its kind in Zambia and a model for the strengthening of indigenous culture.<ref name=""Simbao"">{{cite journal|author=Ruth Kerkham Simbao|title=A crown on the move: stylistic integration of the Luba-Lunda complex in Kazembe performance|journal=African Arts|volume=39|issue=3|pages=26|doi=10.1162/afar.2006.39.3.26|year=2006}}</ref><ref name=""Cancel""/>

Kuomboka,"{{Short description|Traditional annual ceremony in Zambia}}
{{more citations needed|date=January 2021}}
[[Image:Nalikwanda.jpg|thumb|The King's barge]]
[[File:Kuomboka ceremony.jpg|thumb|Paddlers preceding the arrival of the Litunga]]
'''Kuomboka''' is a word in the [[Lozi language]]; it literally means ‘to get out of water’. In today's [[Zambia]] it is applied to a traditional [[ceremony]] that takes place at the end of the rain season, when the upper [[Zambezi River]] floods the plains of the [[Western Province, Zambia|Western Province]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony of the Lozi People: Mongu, Zambia|url=http://wp5.developmenteducation.ie/gallery/kuomboka-ceremony-of-the-lozi-people-mongu-zambia-april-2009/|website=DevelopmentEducation.ie|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>
The festival celebrates the move of the [[Litunga]], king of the [[Lozi people]], from his compound at [[Lealui]] in the [[Barotse Floodplain]] of the [[Zambezi]] River to [[Limulunga]] on higher ground. The return trip is usually held in August with a less publicized journey called the Kufuluhela.

== History ==
Historians claim that before the time of the first known male [[Lozi language|Lozi]] chief Mboo, there came a great flood called Meyi-a-Lungwangwa meaning ""the waters that swallowed everything."" The vast plain was covered in the [[Deluge (history)|deluge]], all animals died and every farm was swept away.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony|url=https://thebestofzambia.com/orgs/kuomboka-ceremony|last=Mongu|first=ZambiaCultural ceremoniesTourist attractions|website=The Best of Zambia|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

People were afraid to escape the flood in their little [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] canoes. So it was that the high god, Nyambe, ordered a man called Nakambela to build the first great canoe, Nalikwanda, which means ""for the people,"" to escape the flood. Thus the start of what is known today as the Kuomboka ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony|url=https://thebestofzambia.com/orgs/kuomboka-ceremony|last=Mongu|first=ZambiaCultural ceremoniesTourist attractions|website=The Best of Zambia|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

== The Procession ==
The ceremony is preceded by heavy drumming of the royal Maoma drums, which echoes around the royal capital the day before Kuomboka, announcing the event.

The Litunga begins the day in traditional dress, but during the journey changes into the full uniform of a British admiral that was presented to the Litunga in 1902 by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], in recognition of treaties signed between the Lozi people and [[Queen Victoria]]. The ceremony is attended by hundreds of people each year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony of the Lozi People: Mongu, Zambia|url=http://wp5.developmenteducation.ie/gallery/kuomboka-ceremony-of-the-lozi-people-mongu-zambia-april-2009/|website=DevelopmentEducation.ie|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

The ceremony begins with two white scout canoes that are sent to check the depth of the water and for the presence of any enemies. Once the scouts signal the ""all clear"", the journey to the highland begins. The Litunga’s royal boat is followed by another boat for his wife and another for the Prime Minister. The journey to Limulunga normally takes about 6–8 hours. Drums beat throughout to coordinate and energise those paddling the barge.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony of the Lozi People: Mongu, Zambia|url=http://wp5.developmenteducation.ie/gallery/kuomboka-ceremony-of-the-lozi-people-mongu-zambia-april-2009/|website=DevelopmentEducation.ie|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> The most important are the three royal war drums – ''kanaona'', ''munanga'', and ''mundili'' –  each more than one metre wide and said to be at least 170 years old.<ref>{{Cite web|title=All set for kuomboka ceremony in Zambia {{!}}{{!}} The Southern Times|url=https://southerntimesafrica.com/site/news/all-set-for-kuomboka-ceremony-in-zambia|website=maxebooking.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

The Litunga is accompanied on the journey by his Prime Minister and other local area chiefs known as the [[InDuna|Indunas]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony of the Lozi People: Mongu, Zambia|url=http://wp5.developmenteducation.ie/gallery/kuomboka-ceremony-of-the-lozi-people-mongu-zambia-april-2009/|website=DevelopmentEducation.ie|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

The King's state [[barge]] is called Nalikwanda and is painted black and white, like Zambia's coat of arms. On the barge is a replica of a huge black elephant, the ears of which can be moved from inside the barge. There is also a fire on board, the smoke from which tells the people that the king is alive and well. The Nalikwanda is large enough to carry his possessions, his attendants, his musicians, his 100 paddlers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kuomboka Ceremony of the Lozi People: Mongu, Zambia|url=http://wp5.developmenteducation.ie/gallery/kuomboka-ceremony-of-the-lozi-people-mongu-zambia-april-2009/|website=DevelopmentEducation.ie|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> It is considered a great honour to be one of the hundred or so paddlers on the ''nalikwanda'' and each paddler wears a [[Headgear|headdress]] of a scarlet beret with a piece of a lion’s mane and a knee-length skirt of animal skins.<ref>{{Cite web|title=All set for kuomboka ceremony in Zambia {{!}}{{!}} The Southern Times|url=https://southerntimesafrica.com/site/news/all-set-for-kuomboka-ceremony-in-zambia|website=maxebooking.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

For his wife there is a second barge. This one has a huge cattle egret (Nalwange) on top. The wings move like the ears of the elephant, up and down.

'''Lealui''' or '''Lialui''' is the [[dry season]] residence on the [[Barotse Floodplain]] of the [[Litunga]], king of the [[Lozi people]] of western [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lealui Palace {{!}} Mongu, Zambia Attractions |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/zambia/mongu/attractions/lealui-palace/a/poi-sig/1553071/1328061 |access-date=2020-05-28 |website=Lonely Planet |language=en}}</ref>  It is located about 14&nbsp;km west of the town of [[Mongu]] and about 10&nbsp;km east of the river's main channel.  At the end of the rainy season, generally in March as the Upper [[Zambezi]] [[flood]] waters encroach on the compound, the Litunga moves to [[Limulunga]] on higher ground.  The move is celebrated in the [[Kuomboka]] festival, one of Zambia's most important and popular.

Lealui is on the Mongu-[[Kalabo]] Road and is at the eastern end of the [[Barotse Floodplain#Barotse Floodplain causeway|Barotse Floodplain causeway]].

[[Image:Mbunda Lukwakwa Symbolic Fence.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mbunda Lukwakwa Symbolic Fence]], [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] used to surround their villages for protection from their enemies]]
 
==Meaning==
The ceremony commemorates the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] conquests as they fought alongside the Aluyi in support of Prince Mubukwanu, one of the sons of the Aluyi King Mulambwa.<ref>''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and Middle East'', Facts On File library of world history, Facts On File, Incorporated, Social Science, Infobase Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|143812676X}}, 9781438126760</ref> It also gives thanks to their Creator the Almighty God for the blessings on them in providing good harvest the past months according to His Love.

==Celebration duration and activities==
The ceremony is celebrated over three days. On the first day, from late in the evening, all the way throughout the night, men sing and dance at the Mukanda circumcision camp, in preparation for the resurrection of the Makishi from the graveyard early in the morning. On the second day, a Makishi masquerade is performed from the Manyinga grave yard in the east, all the way along the Mutanda Chavuma Road to the Senior Chief's palace, where the Makishi pay homage to the Senior Chief. This is followed up by the Makishi dancing the whole day, followed by traditional entertainment the whole evening and throughout the night.

On the third and climax day, Senior Chief Sikufele makes an appearance to the audience gathered in the main arena, accompanied by Government officials that have come to grace the occasion. The Mbunda Speaking People then perform some rituals in the symbolic Lukwakwa fence erected in the middle of the main arena, signifying their military prowess during their travels and conquests. They also praise their Almighty God by dancing their traditional dances such as Kalukuta, Shombe, Chinjangila, Chisho, Nduko and watching dances performed by their not less than fifty (50) exclusive Mbunda Makithi Artifacts.

Additionally the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] showcase their traditional works such as, Iron Ore smelting, wood carvings, basketry and different kinds of handcrafts which are up for sale immediately after the ceremony.

The Mbunda people value their culture and believe, it is one channel of teaching their offspring to respect the older generation and good dressing manners.

Mwela Rock Paintings,"{{Short description|Petroglyphic site in Zambia}}
The '''Mwela Rock Paintings''' are a national monument of [[Zambia]], about {{convert|4.8|km|mi|sp=us}} east of [[Kasama, Zambia|Kasama]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/866/ |title=Mwela and adjacent areas rock art site (Rock paintings) - UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=2009-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610192131/https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/866/ |archivedate=2007-06-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=McIntyre, C.|date=2008|title=Zambia: The Bradt Travel Guide|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|pages=338–9|isbn=978-1841623733}}</ref>

The rock paintings (about 700 in all) are in caves and overhangs spread over a very wide area of bush, north of the Kasama Isoka road at 10°10' S 31°13' E,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zambiatourism.com/destinations/historic/monuments|title=Monuments and Historic Sites}}</ref> where a signpost denotes the ‘Mwela Rocks National Monument’ with an entry kiosk and guides to escort visitors. The site encompasses eastwards rock outcrops of Mwankole, Sumina, Mulundu, Fwambo, Changa Mwibwe and westwards 10&nbsp;km from the town Lwimbo rock outcrops. The paintings are associated with the [[Late Stone Age|Later Stone Age]].

Archaeologists rate the Kasama rock art as one of the largest and most significant collections of ancient art in Southern Africa, though their quality is outdone in Zimbabwe and Namibia. The works are attributed to Stone Age hunter-gatherers (sometimes known as Batwa or Twa) and are up to 2000 years old. Many are abstract designs, but some of the finest pictographs show human figures and animals, often capturing a remarkable sense of fluidity and movement, despite being stylised with huge bodies and minute limbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/zambia/kasama/attractions/kasama-rock-art/a/poi-sig/1294969/1328044|title=Kasama Rock Art &#124; Kasama, Zambia Attractions}}</ref> It is considered the most compact site of rock paintings in Africa.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://zambia.co.zm/news/headlines/2018/01/19/exploring-north-tourism-attractions/ | title=Exploring North tourism attractions }}</ref>

The site was declared a National Monument in 1964, although it got recognition as early as 1945. As of 2017 it was reported to attract an average of 350 local and international tourists per month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.times.co.zm/?p=97960|title = Times of Zambia &#124; 'Invest in camping, lodging facilities at Mwela Rock'}}</ref>

The topography of the site is generally fairly undulating and deeper soils are more frequent, where as the central part is generally flat. The outcrops form part of the boundary of the extension of the main plateau areas. The site is also incised by abundant streams and extends over 100 Km2. More than 1000 paintings have been recorded in the rock outcrops, making Mwela Rock Paintings National Monument as one of the densest concentrations of rock art sites anywhere in Africa.

The site is protected under the National Heritage Conservation Commission (NHCC) Act, Cap 173 of the laws of Zambia and was declared collectively as a National Monument under Government notice No. 255 of 1964 bearing the name of Mwela. Part of the area is further protected under the Forestry Act as it falls within the Kasama Forestry Reserve area under the traditional leadership of Senior Chief Mwamba of the Bemba people of northern Zambia.

Kasama Town falls within the extensions of the main plateau with elevation ranging from 1320 to 1535&nbsp;m. It consists of highlands surrounding the Lake basin area, stretching from Kasama through Mbala, Mporokoso and Kawambwa to Mansa. This plateau region forms part of the Continental divide (up warped plateau) and represents the remnants of the once extensive Miocene peneplain surface.

This site was re-added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on March 10, 2009, in the Mixed category.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5425/|title=Mwela Rock Paintings - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=Whc.unesco.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}</ref>

The growth of the religion suffered during the 80s and 90s on account of increased economic turmoil. After [[Frederick Chiluba]] (a Pentecostal Christian) became President in 1991, Pentecostal congregations expanded considerably around the country.<ref name=""pentecostal"">{{cite thesis| author=Matthew Steel| title=Pentecostalism in Zambia : Power, Authority and the Overcomers| type=MSc Dissertation| publisher=University of Wales| year=2005}}</ref> While the initial constitution did not specify religion, the amendment in 1996 declared the nation as ""a Christian nation while upholding the right of every person to enjoy the person's freedom of conscience and religion"".

{{main|Christianity in Zambia}}
[[File:David Livingstone by Thomas Annan.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[David Livingstone]]]]
Christianity is believed to have arrived in Zambia in the form of European Protestant missionaries and African explorers during the mid of 19th century. [[David Livingstone]] was a Scottish missionary who did pioneering missionary work that brought the attention of Africa to the Western world. Livingstone inspired abolitionists of the slave trade, explorers and missionaries. He led the way in Central Africa to missionaries who initiated the education and health care for Africans. Many African chiefs and tribes held him in high esteem and it was one of the major reasons for facilitating relations between them and the British.<ref name=""Blaikie"">{{cite book|last=Blaikie|first= William Garden|year=1880|title=The Personal Life of David Livingstone|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13262|access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>

[[Zambia]] is officially a [[Christian]] nation according to the 1996 constitution,<ref name=""const"" /> but a wide variety of religious traditions exist. Traditional religious thought blends easily with Christian beliefs in many of the country's [[syncretism|syncretic]] churches. Christian denominations include: [[Presbyterianism]], [[Catholicism in Zambia|Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Pentecostal]], [[New Apostolic Church]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Branhamism]], and a variety of [[Evangelical]] denominations. These grew, adjusted and prospered from the original Catholic missionary settlements ([[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] influences) in the east from [[Mozambique]] and Anglicanism (English and Scottish influences) from the south. Except for some technical positions (e.g. physicians), Western missionary roles have been assumed by native believers.<ref name=""pentecostal""/> Zambia has one of the largest communities of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in Africa with over 200,000 members.<ref>{{cite web|title=2023 Country and Territory Reports|year=2023|url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/2023-service-year-report/2023-country-territory/|publisher=Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society of Pennsylvania}}</ref>

There is also a small [[Jewish]] community, composed mostly of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazis]]. Notable Jewish Zambians have included [[History of the Jews in Zambia|Simon Zukas]], retired Minister, MP and a member of [[Forum for Democracy and Development]] and earlier the [[Movement for Multiparty Democracy|MMD]] and [[United National Independence Party]]. Additionally, the economist [[Stanley Fischer]], who is both the former  governor of the [[Bank of Israel]] and the former head of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], respectively, was born and partially raised in Zambia's Jewish community.

Notable sects, such as the [[Alice Lenshina]]–led [[Lumpa Church]] and the newly established Last Church of Order also exist.

==Humanists and Atheists of Zambia==

'''Humanists and Atheists of Zambia''' (HAZ) is a [[nonprofit organization]] founded in 2018 by Larry Mukwemba Tepa, with Thasiyana Mwandila serving as Vice-President.<ref name=""humanists_creation-of-the-podcast"">{{cite web |title=""Humanism in Zambia"": creation of a 12-episode podcast to spread humanism in the country |url=https://humanists.international/grantee/creation-of-the-podcast-humanism-in-zambia/ |website=Humanists International |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref> The organisation promotes [[secular humanism]] and aims to normalise [[atheism]] in Zambia, where nonbelief is often widely stigmatised.<ref>{{cite web |title=""On we go"": Zambian humanists and atheists look forward to first national meeting – despite moral panic |url=https://humanists.international/2019/07/on-we-go-zambian-humanists-atheists-look-forward-to-first-national-meeting-despite-moral-panic/ |website=Humanists International |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

HAZ organises campaigns and public discussions on topics related to humanism, [[secularism]], and [[human rights]].<ref name=""humanists_creation-of-the-podcast""/> In June 2019, HAZ announced a youth conference scheduled for October that year; the announcement prompted a backlash on social media and calls from some quarters for the Ministry of National Guidance and Religious Affairs (later a department of the Office of the Vice-President) to intervene.<ref>{{cite web |title=Will the Zambian government stop atheist gathering in October? |url=https://zambianeye.com/will-the-zambian-government-stop-atheist-gathering-in-october/ |website=Zambian Eye |date=27 June 2019 |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=National Guidance & Religious Affairs – Office of the Vice President |url=https://www.ovp.gov.zm/?page_id=6854 |website=Office of the Vice-President (Zambia) |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

In 2020, Larry Mukwemba Tepa also established the '''Ethical Society of Zambia''', a national secular humanist community and umbrella for mutual-aid and secular service projects in the country. According to the organisation’s mission statement, the Ethical Society is rooted in secular humanism and naturalism and seeks to promote reason, compassion, democracy, sustainability and human flourishing without reliance on supernatural beliefs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission and Vision |url=https://ethicalsocietyzambia.wordpress.com/mission-and-vision/ |website=The Ethical Society of Zambia |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

The Ethical Society describes a programme of inclusive activities, including weekly gatherings on ethical themes, ethical education for children, youth and adults, social justice and advocacy initiatives (such as projects addressing poverty, gender equity, education and environmental sustainability), community service and cultural events, and secular ceremonies for life transitions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission and Vision |url=https://ethicalsocietyzambia.wordpress.com/mission-and-vision/ |website=The Ethical Society of Zambia |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

In 2023 the Ethical Society received a grant to support an *Indigenous Language Literacy for Adult Education* project, led by Busubo Mwewa; the award and launch of the project were publicly announced via the organisation’s social media and by the grantmaker. The programme offers adult literacy instruction in local languages such as Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, Lunda and Kaonde through community-based learning and mobile approaches, with aims that include improving employment opportunities, health and civic participation and supporting cultural preservation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Embracing Culture, Empowering Lives! |url=https://www.facebook.com/story.php?id=100064863753558&story_fbid=734026885436097 |website=Facebook (The Pollination Project) |date=2023 |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ethical Society of Zambia – Embracing Culture, Empowering Lives! |url=https://www.facebook.com/ethicalsocietyofzambia/ |website=Facebook (Ethical Society of Zambia) |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

}}</ref> Some African nations such as [[Zambia]] have a vast internal consumer demand for second-hand clothes or hand-me-downs from rich nations in North America and Europe. The clothes arrive in these local markets in large bales or packages and are then cut open so buyers can sort through them and pick what article they like the most.

The salaula industry faces many criticisms. One is that it tends to disturb the internal textile industry. Local textile business cannot compete with cheap used clothes coming from abroad. Defendants of the industry argue that market demand should dictate what is fair or not. 

Another criticism is towards the profit companies are generating from these clothes since these clothes were originally donated to non-profit organizations such as [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]]. Defendants of the practice argue that non-profit organization must sell these donations in order to acquire money necessary to fund their social projects.

Tonga baskets,"{{More references|date=December 2009}}

'''Tonga baskets''' or '''Binga baskets''' are baskets woven by the [[Tonga people (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]] women of the [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Province]] of [[Zambia]], who are renowned for their [[basket weaving]]. The baskets have a distinctive design with a square bottom forming the foundation of the basket.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Lisa|first1=Cliggett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9sWAgAAQBAJ&q=Tonga+Craft+Centre&pg=PA121|title=Tonga Timeline: Appraising Sixty Years of Multidisciplinary Research in Zambia and Zimbabwe|last2=Virginia|first2=Bond|date=2013-11-11|publisher=The Lembani Trust|isbn=978-9982-9972-7-0|language=en}}</ref>

It takes approximately two weeks to complete a basket about 35 cm in diameter. The baskets are made from the ilala or malala [[Arecaceae|palm]] (''mapokwe'' in Tonga), which, although growing freely, is also planted by Tonga women for the purpose of basket making.  This re-planting became standard practice in the late 1980s with the opening of the Tonga Craft Centre in [[Binga village]], [[Zimbabwe]] a centre funded by the [[Government of Denmark|Danish government]], which exported thousands of baskets a year. This craft centre was meant to keep the traditional crafts alive: basket-making, [[drum]] making, [[carving]], [[pottery]], and [[Beadwork|beading]]. The Tonga live in an area prone to drought and poverty, and the basket making helped the women feed their families.

Traditionally, the baskets are used for carrying [[maize]] or [[sorghum]] from the fields and then winnowing the grain. Traditional designs includes stripes, a spider web type pattern and a lightning pattern. Some Tonga, typically women, partake in basket weaving as a source of income.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Manyena |first=Siambabala Bernard |last2=Fordham |first2=Maureen |last3=Collins |first3=Andrew |date=2008 |title=Disaster Resilience and Children: Managing Food Security in Zimbabwe's Binga District |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7721/chilyoutenvi.18.1.0303 |journal=Children, Youth and Environments |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=15 |doi=10.7721/chilyoutenvi.18.1.0303?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |issn=1546-2250}}</ref>

[[Zambia]] is a [[developing country]], and it achieved middle-income status in 2011. Through the first decade of the 21st century, the '''economy of Zambia''' was one of the fastest-growing economies in [[Economy of Africa|Africa]], and its capital, [[Lusaka]], the fastest-growing city in the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).<ref name=""SADC"">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadc.int/member-states/zambia/|title=SADC Country Profile Zambia}}</ref> Zambia's economic performance has stalled in recent years due to declining copper prices, significant fiscal deficits, and energy shortages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=African Development Bank|first=African Development Fund|date=2016|title=Zambia Country Profile|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Generic-Documents/Zambia_Country_Profile.pdf|access-date=5 November 2020|website=African Development Bank}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Overview|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zambia/overview|access-date=2020-11-05|website=World Bank|language=en}}</ref> The economy has been reliant on mineral extraction since the 1920s, in particular copper.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chitonge |first=Horman |title=The Zambian Economy |date=2024 |work=The Oxford Handbook of the Zambian Economy |pages=1–12 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780192864222.013.1 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-286422-2 |last2=Marewo |first2=Malvern |last3=Kabinga |first3=Mundia |last4=Fundanga |first4=Caleb M. |last5=Songwe |first5=Vera}}</ref><ref name=""EZ"">{{Citation |last=Seekings |first=Jeremy |title=The Economic History of Zambia |date=2024 |work=The Oxford Handbook of the Zambian Economy |pages=37–57 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780192864222.013.3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-286422-2 |last2=Tembo |first2=Alfred}}</ref>

Upon achieving independence, Zambia had a higher GDP per capita than almost all sub-Saharan African countries.<ref name=""EZ"" /> Over the subsequent decades, Zambia's economy contracted, in part due to declining copper prices.<ref name=""EZ"" /> Since the 2000s, Zambia's economy has been growing.<ref name=""EZ"" /> As of 2019, Zambia's GDP per capita (current international dollars) stands at $1,305.00.

Zambia is one of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s most [[urbanization|urbanized]] countries. About one-half of the country's 16 million people are concentrated in a few urban zones strung along the major transportation corridors, while rural areas are under-populated. 

Copper and cobalt are among Zambia's main exports, while non-traditional exports include cotton, coffee, fresh flowers, burley tobacco, gemstones and maize (corn). Zambia is eligible to export duty-free goods to the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act ([[AGOA]]); the Act allows eligible countries from sub-Saharan Africa to export over 6,400 goods to the [[United States]].<ref name=""Overview"">{{Cite web |title=Overview |url=https://www.zambiaembassy.org/page/trade-and-economy |access-date=2021-05-24 |website=Zambia n Embassy |language=en}}</ref>

Copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and the opening of new mines. The maize harvest was again good in 2005, helping boost GDP and agricultural exports. Cooperation continues with international bodies on programs to reduce poverty, including a new lending arrangement with the IMF in the second quarter of 2004.<ref name=""Overview"" />

== History ==
=== Economic policies soon after independence (1964–1967) ===
[[File:GDP per capita development of Zambia.svg|thumb|GDP per capita development of Zambia, since 1950]]
The [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC, originally set up by the British imperialist [[Cecil Rhodes]]) retained commercial assets and mineral rights that it acquired from a concession signed with the Litunga of Barotseland in 1892 (the [[Lochner Concession]]). Only by threatening to expropriate the BSAC, on the eve of independence, did the incoming Zambian government manage to get the BSAC to relinquish the mineral rights. The Federation's government assigned roles to each of the three territories: Southern Rhodesia was assigned the responsibility of providing managerial and administrative skills; Northern Rhodesia provided copper revenues; and Nyasaland provided the Black labour.

After independence, Zambia instituted a program of national development plans, under the direction of a National Commission for Development Planning: the Transitional Development Plan (1964–66) was followed by the First National Development Plan (1966–71). These two plans, which provided for major investment in infrastructure and manufacturing, were largely implemented and were generally successful. This was not true for subsequent plans.

=== The Mulungushi Economic Reforms (1968) ===

A major switch in the structure of Zambia's economy came with the Mulungushi Reforms of April 1968: the government declared its intention to acquire equity holdings (usually 51% or more) in a number of key foreign-owned firms, to be controlled by a parastatal conglomerate named the Industrial Development Corporation (INDECO).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kaunda|first=Kenneth|title=Mulungushi reforms|publisher=Zambia Information Services|year=1970|location=University of Zambia Library}}</ref> By January 1970, Zambia had acquired majority holding in the Zambian operations of the two major foreign mining corporations, the [[Anglo American Corporation]] and the Rhodesia Selection Trust (RST); the two became the Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines (NCCM) and Roan Consolidated Mines (RCM), respectively. The Zambian government then created a new parastatal body, the Mining Development Corporation (MINDECO). The Finance and Development Corporation (FINDECO) allowed the Zambian government to gain control of insurance companies and building societies. However, foreign-owned banks (such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Grindlays) successfully resisted takeover. In 1971, INDECO, MINDECO, and FINDECO were brought together under an omnibus parastatal, the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO), to create one of the largest companies in sub-Saharan Africa, with the country's president, [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as chairman of the board. The management contracts under which day-to-day operations of the mines had been carried out by Anglo American and RST were ended in 1973. In 1982 NCCM and RCM were merged into the giant [[Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd]] (ZCCM).

In 1973 a massive increase in the price of oil was followed by a slump in copper prices in 1975, resulting in a diminution of export earnings. In 1973 the price of copper accounted for 95% of all export earnings; this halved in value on the world market in 1975. By 1976 Zambia had a balance-of-payments crisis, and rapidly became massively indebted to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Third National Development Plan (1978–83) had to be abandoned as crisis management replaced long-term planning.

By the mid-1980s Zambia was one of the most indebted nations in the world, relative to its gross domestic product (GDP). The IMF was insisting that the Zambian government should introduce programs aimed at stabilizing the economy and restructuring it to reduce dependence on copper. The proposed measures included: the ending of price controls; devaluation of the kwacha (Zambia's currency); cut-backs in government expenditure; cancellation of subsidies on food and fertilizer; and increased prices for farm produce. Kaunda's removal of food subsidies caused massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs; the country's urbanized population rioted in protest. In desperation, Kaunda broke with the IMF in May 1987 and introduced a New Economic Recovery Programme in 1988. However, this did not help him and he eventually moved toward a new understanding with the IMF in 1989. In 1990 Kaunda was forced to make a major policy volteface: he announced the intention to partially privatize the parastatals. Time, however, was running out for him. Like many African independence leaders Kaunda tried to hang on to power but unlike many he called multiparty elections and lost them to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and abided by the results. Kaunda left office with the inauguration of MMD leader Frederick Chiluba as president on 2 November 1991.

=== Chiluba's economic reforms (1991–2000) ===

Zambia's Economic System of Government is Unitary because of that the [[Frederick Chiluba]] government (1991–2001), which came to power after democratic multi-[[political party|party]] elections in November 1991, was committed to extensive economic reform.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chiluba|first=Frederick|title=Democracy: The challenge of change|publisher=Lusaka: Multimedia|year=1995|isbn=9982300539|location=University of Zambia Library}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2021}}

Zambia's  economic  transformation  into  a  free  market  system  began  toward  the  end  of  1991  following a change of government. To tackle a serious economic crisis, the government agreed to introduce substantial economic reforms to secure much-needed loans from the World Bank and IMF.<ref name=""CR"">{{cite web |date=19 May 2021 |title=Zambia Country Report 2020 |url=https://www.bti-project.org/content/en/downloads/reports/country_report_2020_ZMB.pdf |access-date=19 May 2021 |website=BTI Transformation Index}}</ref>

One of the greatest challenges was the privatization of the country's copper mines, Zambia's prime export earner. The government [[privatization|privatised]] many state industries, and maintained positive real [[interest rate]]s.  Exchange controls were eliminated and [[free market]] principles endorsed. It remains to be seen whether the [[Levy Mwanawasa|Mwanawasa]] government will follow a similar path of implementing [[economic reform]] and undertaking further privatization.  Zambia has yet to address issues such as reducing the size of the [[public sector]], which still represents 44% of total [[informal sector|formal employment]], and improving Zambia's [[social sector]] delivery systems.

After the government privatized the giant parastatal [[mining]] [[types of companies|company]] [[ZCCM Investments Holdings|Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines]] (ZCCM), donors resumed balance-of-payment support. The final transfer of ZCCM's assets occurred on March 31, 2000. Although balance-of-payment payments are not the answer to Zambia's long-term debt problems, it will in the short term provide the government some breathing room to implement further economic reforms. The government has, however, spent much of its [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] reserves to intervene in the [[exchange rate]] mechanism. To continue to do so, however, would jeopardize Zambia's debt relief. Zambia qualified for [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries|HIPC]] debt relief in 2000, contingent upon the country meeting certain performance criteria, and this should offer a long-term solution to Zambia's debt situation.

=== 2001–2010 ===
On 2 January 2002, MMD's [[Levy Mwanawasa]] won the presidential election which many observers claimed had actually been won by the opposition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zambia's Fourth Democratic Elections: A Country of Minority Governments - By Tiens Kahenya, UPND Secretary General |url=http://www.africaliberalnetwork.org/newsletter_item.aspx?i_PageID=1420&i_NewsID=24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614095733/http://www.africaliberalnetwork.org/newsletter_item.aspx?i_PageID=1420&i_NewsID=24 |archive-date=14 June 2008 |access-date=15 September 2009 |publisher=Africaliberalnetwork.org |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In January 2003, the Zambian Government informed the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities.

Foreign investors liked Mwanawasa, owing partly to his [[anti-corruption]] drive. During his presidency, [[Zambia]] received [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]].<ref name=""cabbage"">[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?STORY_ID=11968403 Zambia: Why Africa needs more cabbage] The Economist</ref> The main driver of economic growth was minerals.

{{main|Mining in Zambia}}

In 2019, the country was the world's 7th largest producer of [[copper]].<ref>[https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf USGS Copper Production Statistics]</ref>

The Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper-mining industry. The industrialization of the copper industry is owed partly to [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the famous American scout who worked for [[Cecil Rhodes]].<ref name=""juang2008"">{{cite book |last=Juang |first=Richard M. |title=Africa and the Americas: culture, politics, and history : a multidisciplinary encyclopedia, Volume 2 Transatlantic relations series |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=1157 |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-85109-441-7}}</ref> By 1998, however, output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 [[tonne]]s, continuing a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, and until recently, low copper prices and uncertainty over privatization. In 2001, the first full year of a privatized industry, Zambia recorded its first year of increased productivity since 1973. The future of the copper industry in Zambia was thrown into doubt in January 2002, when investors in Zambia's largest copper mine announced their intention to withdraw their investment. However, surging copper prices from 2004 to the present day rapidly rekindled international interest in Zambia's copper sector with a new buyer found for KCCM and massive investments in expanding capacity launched. China has become a major investor in the Zambian copper industry, and in February 2007, the two countries announced the creation of a Chinese-Zambian economic partnership zone around the Chambishi copper mine.<ref>{{cite news|title=China's Trade in Africa Carries a Price Tag|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/world/africa/21zambia.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 21, 2007}}</ref>

Today copper mining is central to the economic prospects for Zambia and covers 85% of all the country's exports, but concerns remain that the economy is not diversified enough to cope with a collapse in international copper prices.

=== Agriculture ===
The [[agriculture]] sector represented 2.7% [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) {{!}} Data|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS?view=chart|access-date=2021-10-20|website=data.worldbank.org}}</ref> Agriculture accounted for 85% of total [[employment]] (formal and informal) for 2000. [[Maize]] (corn) is the principal [[cash crop]] as well as the [[staple food]]. Other important crops include [[soybean]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[sunflower seed]]s, [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[pearl millet]], [[cassava]], [[tobacco]] and various [[vegetable]] and [[fruit]] crops. [[Floriculture]] is a growth sector, and agricultural non-traditional [[exports]] now rival the mining industry in foreign exchange receipts. Zambia has the potential for significantly increasing its agricultural output; currently, less than 20% of its [[arable land]] is cultivated.

In 2019, Zambia generated a total of 15,013GWh of Energy. 12,427GWh was Renewable and 2,586 GWh was non-renewable. Over 99% of the [[Renewable energy]] component was Hydro electricity.<ref name=""EP"">{{Cite web |last=IRENA |date=29 September 2021 |title=Zambia: Energy Profile |url=https://www.irena.org/IRENADocuments/Statistical_Profiles/Africa/Zambia_Africa_RE_SP.pdf |access-date=17 April 2022 |website=irena.org}}</ref>

With a view to diversifying the power generation profile, Zambia increased its Solar Power generation Capacity in 2019.<ref name=""EP"" />

In March 2019, the 54MW [[Bangweulu Solar Power Station]] was commissioned.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jean Marie Takouleu |date=20 March 2019 |title=Zambia: Bangweulu's Solar Park (54MW) Recently Delivered by NEOEN and IDC |url=https://www.afrik21.africa/en/zambia-bangweulus-solar-park-54-mw-recently-delivered-by-neoen-and-idc/ |access-date=17 April 2021 |website=afrik21.africa/en/}}</ref>

In July 2022, the local National utility [[ZESCO]], announced it had achieved an electricity generation surplus of about 1,156 MW. Zambia's national generation capacity stands at 3,456.8 MW versus a peak national demand of 2,300 MW. The surplus power is to be directed to service the power supply agreements for the export of 180 MW to [[Namibia]] and 100 MW to [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=english.news.cn |date=21 July 2022 |title=Zambia to export surplus electricity to Namibia, Zimbabwe |url=https://english.news.cn/20220721/5617eea6a07b433e90adaef1dae3c9ec/c.html |access-date=27 July 2022 |website=english.news.cn}}</ref> The exportation of 100MW electricity to Zimbabwe which is set to commence in August 2022 is under a five-year contract with a condition precedent that ZESCO earns monthly income of US$6.3 million prior exporting to Zimbabwe.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lusaka Times |date=27 July 2022 |title=ZESCO to commence the exportation of electricity to Zimbabwe |url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2022/07/27/zesco-to-commence-the-exportation-of-electricity-to-zimbabwe/ |access-date=28 July 2022 |website=lusakatimes.com}}</ref>

The close of 2022 brought in some serious challenges to the Zambian economy, when low water levels at the Kariba Dam significantly impacted the 1080MW Kariba Hydro Power plant's output capacity and resulted in load shedding for businesses and residents across the country. This was compounded by the maintenance that was being carried out at the 300MW Maamba Coilleries Coal Fired Power Plant.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MUCHIYA |first=TYNDALE |date=6 December 2022 |title=Poor planning by ZESCO to blame for load shedding |url=https://zambianbusinesstimes.com/poor-planning-by-zesco-to-blame-for-load-shedding-zaca/ |access-date=18 January 2023 |website=zambianbusinesstimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=MUCHIYA |first=TYNDALE |date=13 January 2023 |title=Why ZESCO bosses responsible for return of load shedding should be fired |url=https://zambianbusinesstimes.com/why-zesco-bosses-responsible-for-return-of-load-shedding-should-be-fired/ |access-date=18 January 2023 |website=zambianbusinesstimes.com}}</ref>

In January 2023, Zambia signed a US$2 billion dollar MOU and Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the [[United Arab Emirates]] for the development of 2000MW of Solar Power Projects.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mitimingi |first=Taonga, Clifford |date=17 January 2023 |title=Zambia signs 2 Billion USD Solar Power Development Pact with the UAE |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/zambia-signs-2-billion-solar-power-development-pact-with-uae?leadSource=uverify%20wall |access-date=18 January 2023 |website=bloomberg.com}}</ref>

In April 2023, Zambia, through its state owned utility company [[ZESCO]] Limited, signed a ZMW 67 Billion (US$3.4 Billion) [[Power purchase agreement|Power Purchase Agreement]] with [[Integrated Clean Energy Power Company]] of [[China]] to produce 2,400 Mega Watts of [[renewable energy]]. Implementation of the project is expected to be done in a phased manner with the first phase producing 600MW of solar energy distributed as one 300MW power plant in [[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]] and another 300MW Power plant in [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Province]]. The two 300MW solar power plants of phase one are expected to be connected to the National Grid by the end of 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 April 2023 |title=Zesco Signs Deal With China's CiEG To Produce $3.5 Billion Worth Of Renewable Energy |url=https://www.openzambia.com/economics/2023/4/4/zesco-signs-deal-with-chinas-cieg-to-produce-35-billion-worth-of-renewable-energy |access-date=8 April 2023 |website=openzambia.com}}</ref>

Zambia is a net importer of petroleum and in 2019, Oil & Mineral Fuels ranked top amongst the country's trade imports at a value of U$1.26 billion.<ref>{{Cite web |last=globaledge |date=21 January 2022 |title=Trade Statistics on Zambia |url=https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/zambia/tradestats |access-date=21 April 2022 |website=globaledge.msu.edu}}</ref>

In January 2022, the ERB migrated from a Quarterly pricing cycle to a monthly pricing cycle to enable the  local price of fuel to be more responsive to the market fundamentals namely: international oil prices and the Kwacha/US Dollar exchange rate prevailing in the month preceding the pricing decision.<ref name="":16"">{{Cite web |last=lusakatimes |date=29 January 2022 |title=UPND faces a dilemma of how to honour their election promise of cutting fuel prices |url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2022/01/29/upnd-faces-a-dilemma-of-how-to-honour-their-election-promise-of-cutting-fuel-prices/ |access-date=1 June 2022 |website=lusakatimes.com}}</ref> Further, following the UPND governments' policy decision to place [[Indeni Petroleum Refinery|INDENI Petroleum Refinery]] on [[care and maintenance]], the nation moved to one type of [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]] sold on the market, and that is the imported [[Low-sulphur diesel|Low Sulphur Gasoil/Diesel]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=erb.org |date=28 January 2022 |title=Petroleum Pump Prices Revised |url=https://www.erb.org.zm/petroleum-pump-prices-revised |access-date=1 June 2022 |website=erb.org.zm}}</ref>

=== Media ===
* [[Mass media in Zambia]]

== Infrastructure ==
There are many forms of transport in Zambia. Zambia is highly dependent on [[road transport]].
* [[Transport in Zambia]]
* [[Roads in Zambia]]
* [[List of airports in Zambia]].
* [[Rail transport in Zambia]]
* [[Water transport in Zambia]]

==Growth==

There are, however, positive [[macroeconomic]] signs, rooted in reforms implemented in the early and mid-1990s. Zambia's [[floating exchange rate]] and open [[capital market]]s have provided useful discipline on the government, while at the same time allowing continued diversification of Zambia's export sector, growth in the [[tourist industry]], and procurement of inputs for growing businesses. Some parts of the [[Copper Belt]] have experienced a significant revival as spin-off effects from the massive capital reinvestment are experienced.

=== Export Diversification ===
As Zambia continued on its path to diversifying from dependence on Copper with an emphasis on growth in [[agriculture]], in April 2022, the country's  Ministry of Agriculture through the Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service (PQPS) approved the first consignment of over 37 metric tons of Zambian grown [[avocado]]s for export to countries in the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Daily Mail |date=19 April 2022 |title=37mt-of-avocados-europe-bound |url=http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/37mt-of-avocados-europe-bound/ |access-date=20 April 2022 |website=daily-mail.co.zm}}</ref>

=== Salaula ===
{{See also|Salaula}}
Standard economic theory and empirical data indicates that second-hand clothing import can have positive effects in a country like Zambia (one of the least developed countries in the world). The ''[[salaula]]'' market reduces the proportion of income that a family has to spend on clothing. It also helps to keep employments like repairs and alterations in business and forces tailors to proceed into more specialize production of styled garments.<ref>Hansen, Karen Tranberg. 2004. Helping or hindering? Controversies around the international second-hand clothing trade. Anthropology Today 20 (4):3-9.</ref>

There is a downside to such imports, however; the massive importation of used clothing from the developed world has resulted in a near-total collapse of the Zambian indigenous textile industry.  In the face of cheap used clothing, tailors' specialized production may be irrelevant - customers will buy the least expensive clothing available, irrespective of style.  Those who might otherwise work at textile mills or clothing factories are left jobless, or else make significantly less money in the salaula resale business.

==Inflation==
[[File:GDP per capita (current), % of world average, 1960-2012; Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique.png|thumb|300px|left|GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average = 100)]]

Lack of [[balance of payments|balance-of-payment]] support meant the Zambian government did not have resources for [[capital investment]] and periodically had to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] or otherwise expand the money supply to try to meet its spending and debt obligations. The government continued these activities even after balance-of-payment support resumed. This has kept interest rates at levels that are too high for local business, fuelled [[inflation]], burdened the budget with domestic debt payments, while still falling short of meeting the public payroll and other needs, such as [[infrastructure]] rehabilitation. The government was forced to draw down [[foreign exchange reserves]] sharply in 1998 to meet foreign debt obligations, putting further pressure on the [[Zambian kwacha|kwacha]] and inflation. Inflation held at 32% in 2000; consequently, the kwacha lost the same value against the [[dollar]] over the same period. In mid- to late 2001, Zambia's fiscal management became more conservative. As a result, 2001 year-end inflation was below 20%, its best result in decades. In 2002 inflation rose to 26.7%. However, in 2007 inflation hit 8%, the first time in 30 years that Zambia had seen single digit inflation.

On January 27, 2011, it was reported by the Central Statistical Office that inflation rose to 9%.<ref>{{Citation |title=Zambia Annual Inflation Accelerates to 9% in December, State Agency Says |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-27/zambia-annual-inflation-accelerates-to-9-in-december-update1-.html |year=2011 |publication-place=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |publisher=bloomberg.com}}</ref> in 2012

Between April  2019 and April 2020 Zambia' s Annual inflation rate rose to 15.7% from 14% in March 2020. The rise  of prices in food and other non- food items led to the increase in the Annual inflation rate.<ref name="":6"">{{Cite web |last=Zambia Statistics Agency |date=30 April 2020 |title=The Monthly Bulletin |url=https://www.zamstats.gov.zm/phocadownload/Monthly/2020/Vol%20205%202020%20The%20Monthly%20April.pdf#page=3 |access-date=26 May 2020 |website=zamstats.gov.zm |archive-date=30 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730234631/https://www.zamstats.gov.zm/phocadownload/Monthly/2020/Vol%20205%202020%20The%20Monthly%20April.pdf#page=3 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

However, it is significant that inflation often peaks in election years, hitting a recent high of 17.9% in 2016. This  suggests  that  a  further  peak  is  likely  approaching  during  the  2021  general  elections. The value of the kwacha against the dollar has been relatively consistent for the past two years and has yet to return to the recent high of almost 0.2 kwacha to the dollar in 2013. Nonetheless, the real effective exchange rate of the kwacha against a weighted average of foreign currencies improved from 88.5 in 2016 to 96.4 in 2017. The kwacha lost value against the dollar in September 2018 but has remained fairly consistent at 0.08 to the dollar in November to December, though further instability remains likely due to both political and economic uncertainty.<ref name=""CR"" />

The '''Bank of Zambia''' ('''BoZ'''), is the [[central bank]] of [[Zambia]].

==Overview==
The principal responsibility of the bank is to create and implement [[monetary policy]] that will maintain the economic stability of the country. The Bank is active in promoting [[financial inclusion]] policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the [[the Maya Declaration|Maya Declaration]], during the [[AFI Global Policy Forum|Global Policy Forum]], held in [[Riviera Maya]], [[Mexico]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maya Declaration Urges Financial Inclusion for World's Unbanked Populations|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maya-declaration-urges-financial-inclusion-for-worlds-unbanked-populations-130887928.html |date=30 September 2011|accessdate=20 April 2014|publisher=PR Newswire|first=for Financial Inclusion|last=Alliance}}</ref>

== Functions of Bank of Zambia ==

# To ensure appropriate monetary policy formulation and implementation;
# To  provide banking services to Government, [[Commercial bank|commercial banks]] and to act as Settlement Agent;
# To license, regulate and supervise banks and financial service institutions;
# To ensure a safe and sound financial system and;
# To manage the banking, currency and payment systems operations of the Bank of Zambia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bank of Zambia|url=https://www.boz.zm/about/values-and-functions.htm|last=|first=|date=2020-05-27|website=Bank of Zambia|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305044320/http://www.boz.zm:80/about/values-and-functions.htm |archive-date=2017-03-05 |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

== Administration ==
Since its inception, the Bank of Zambia has gone through various changes in its organisational structure. Over time, this has resulted into an organisational structure which has become more focused on the core activities of the central bank. Furthermore, the Bank has shed off staff in areas where outsiders could easily be contracted to provide the same services more satisfactorily. The areas now being contracted to external bodies include: outside security, canteen services, club and maintenance. As a result of the restructuring exercise, the Bank has seen the total number of staff fall from 1,400 to well below 850. But while more such functions have been dropped, others more critical in the new liberalised environment have emerged. These new areas are mainly in the policy making arena.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bank of Zambia|url=https://www.boz.zm/about/management-structure.htm|last=|first=|date=2020-05-27|website=Bank of Zambia|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212154417/http://www.boz.zm:80/about/management-structure.htm |archive-date=2017-02-12 |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

The Bank of Zambia has fourteen departments: Banking, Currency and Payment Systems, Bank Supervision, Board Services, Economics, Finance, Financial Markets, Human Resources, Information and Communication Technology, Internal Audit, Legal Services, Non-Bank Financial Institution Supervision, Procurement and Maintenance Services, Strategy and Risk Management, and the Security Division.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bank of Zambia|url=https://www.boz.zm/about/departments.htm|last=|first=|date=2020-05-27|website=Bank of Zambia|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212094403/http://www.boz.zm:80/about/departments.htm |archive-date=2017-02-12 |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

== Board of directors ==
The board of the Bank of Zambia is composed of the [[governor]], who is the chairperson, and six other directors appointed by the Minister of Finance and National Planning. The directors are appointed from among persons with professional or academic experience in business or financial matters and who are not officials or employees of the bank. All directors of the board are non-executive directors. The Secretary to the Treasury is an [[Ex officio member|ex-officio member]] of the board and without power to vote. The [[Secretary to the Treasury]] also does not count for a quorum. The vice chairperson is elected by the board from among the members of the board. Directors of the board are appointed for a period of three years and are eligible to be reappointed for another three years. The board is the overall authority in which all the powers of the bank are vested. It is responsible for formulation of the Bank of Zambia policy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bank of Zambia|url=https://www.boz.zm/about/board-of-directors.htm|last=|first=|date=2020-05-27|website=Bank of Zambia|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219104603/http://www.boz.zm:80/about/board-of-directors.htm |archive-date=2017-02-19 |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

==History==
The Bank of Zambia has origins in the 1937 formation of the [[Southern Rhodesia Currency Board]], which was based in [[Harare]], in present-day [[Zimbabwe]]. The board's jurisdiction included [[Northern Rhodesia]], now called [[Zambia]] and [[Nyasaland]], known as [[Malawi]] today.

In 1954, the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board was renamed the [[Currency Board of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], the currency board was transformed into the [[Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] in 1956.  

In 1964, the '''Bank of Zambia''' was created from the [[Bank of Northern Rhodesia]], which itself had only formed a year earlier in 1963 from the [[Lusaka]] branch of the Rhodesia and Nyasaland bank.  

After its creation, and after the passage of the [[Bank of Zambia Act]] in 1965, the bank grew and was successful down through the decades. According to its website, the bank acquired an [[Equity (finance)|equity stake]] in the [[Development Bank of Zambia]] and the [[Zambia National Commercial Bank]] and was even considering diversifying into the agricultural sector.

In 1991, the [[Movement for Multiparty Democracy|Movement for Multi-party Democracy]] (MMD) came to power in Zambia, replacing the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) which had ruled for 27 years. The new government's fiscal priorities included [[liberalization]] and privatization, which included the Zambian copper industry and Zambian [[ZCCM Investments Holdings|Consolidated Copper Mines]] (ZCCM), the company that controlled copper production in Zambia.{{cn|date=January 2021}}

==Governors==
The '''[[Governor]]''' is the head of the '''Bank of Zambia'''.

As of August 2022, the Governor serves a six-year term, which will be renewable for further term of six years, after being nominated by the [[President of Zambia]] and confirmed by the [[National Assembly of Zambia]] following a new legislation – Bank of Zambia (BOZ) Act No. 5 of 2022.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |last=lusakatimes |date=22 August 2022 |title=boz-governor-and-deputies-gets-protection-they-cant-be-fired-without-valid-reasons |url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2022/08/22/boz-governor-and-deputies-gets-protection-they-cant-be-fired-without-valid-reasons/ |website=lusakatimes.com}}</ref> The new act also serves to further the independence of the Central Bank by providing security of tenure for the Governor and his deputies, who, in the event of any allegations, are to be brought before a three-person [[tribunal]] headed by [[Judge]] or former Judge with the other two members being persons with knowledge and experience in the field of [[central banking]] or [[economics]], [[finance]], [[law]] or any other field that is related to central banking.<ref name="":0"" />

Despite several steps taken by the previous government in order to fight '''corruption in [[Zambia]]''', there has not been a dramatic improvement in the public perception of anti-corruption efforts over the past years. [[Corruption]] remains pervasive in the country, yet in April 2014 the Business Anti-Corruption Portal reported that the situation in Zambia is relatively better than that of other countries in the region.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

In 2024, Zambia scored 39 on a scale from 0 (""highly corrupt"") to 100 (""very clean"").

Unnecessarily long and complicated administrative procedures are common in [[Zambia|Zambia's]] business environment, leading many companies to operate in the [[Informal economy|informal sector]]. The risk of widespread use of [[Facilitating payment|facilitation payments]] is also high due to the bureaucratic procedures for obtaining licences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zambia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|date=April 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000528/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

Political corruption is seen as the most prevalent, specifically bribery. According to the Global Corruption Barometer Africa 2019 survey by Transparency International, 18% of public service users have paid a bribe in the past twelve months. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Global Corruption Barometer - Africa 2019 |url=https://www.transparency.org/en/gcb/africa/africa-2019 |access-date=2025-03-17 |website=Transparency.org |language=en}}</ref> 

Britain, Finland, Ireland and Sweden stopped their financial aid which was $34 million to Zambia due to corruption and [[financial mismanagement]] in 2018. A year later, Britain urged Zambia to take serious measures to fight corruption to get financial assistance. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zambia-corruption-idUSKCN1VH1S7|title=Britain urges Zambia to fight corruption to unlock aid|date=2019-08-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-28|language=en}}</ref>

Land reform in Zambia,"'''Land reform in Zambia''' refers to the process of [[land reform]] in [[Zambia]].

==Zimbabwean farmers==
In 2001, neighbouring [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's government]] undertook aggressive land reform policies which included invasions of [[White people in Zimbabwe|farms owned by White Zimbabweans]]. Many of those farmers moved to Zambia and took up farming again. They produced [[maize]] and [[tobacco]] on large farms.<ref>[https://www.baltimoresun.com/2004/07/06/zimbabwe-farmers-set-roots-in-zambia/ Zimbabwe farmers set roots in Zambia] ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', 6 July, 2004</ref>

Revenue stamps of Rhodesia,"{{short description|Stamps issued by Rhodesia}}
[[File:Southern Rhodesia 1937 3 Shilling Revenue Stamp.jpg|right|thumb|A Southern Rhodesia revenue stamp from 1937.]]
'''[[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]]''', now divided between '''[[Zambia]]''' and '''[[Zimbabwe]]''', first issued '''[[revenue stamp]]s''' in 1890, and Zimbabwe continues to do so to this day.<ref name=""barefoot""/>

==British South Africa Company==
The [[British South Africa Company]] issued revenue stamps for use in all of [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia]] from 1890 to 1909. The first issue had four values from £1 to £10 and they bore the company's coat of arms. These were issued in the form of postage stamps but due to their high values they never required for postal use so they are regarded by many as purely revenue stamps. In 1896, some of these were surcharged with values between £50 and £200. These are exceedingly rare as few were printed. Later in 1896, a new square design still featuring the coat of arms but with a more ornate frame was issued. This was replaced in 1898 with a design similar to the original 1890 issue but with some differences in the stamp's border. This set included a £100 cherry red value, which is very rare and only six copies of the stamp are known to exist.<ref name=""feldman""/> Around 1907, some of these stamps were overprinted '''REVENUE''' to disqualify them from postal use, and in 1909 the £1 to £5 values were overprinted '''RHODESIA''' when the company approved this usage on its stamps. These continued to be used until the 1920s.

Around 1905, a set of cigarette [[excise stamp]]s were issued, and these are rare as they were usually torn upon use.

==Southern Rhodesia==
[[File:Q.Q. Mines cheque Southern Rhodesia 1940.jpg|thumb|Southern Rhodesian postage and revenue stamps fiscally used on a cheque in 1940.]]
[[Southern Rhodesia]] became a separate colony in 1923, and in 1924 its first revenue issues portraying [[King George V]] in a military uniform were issued. These were replaced by a new issue portraying an elderly King George in 1930. Following his death, in 1937 a set showing the new monarch [[King George VI]] was issued. This had nine values from 3/- to £50. The rarest value is the 7/6 black as it was withdrawn soon after issue, and genuinely used stamps can now fetch over £3000. In 1954, a large set showing the coat of arms was issued with values ranging from 1d to £50. 
In the 1930s, banderole [[excise stamp]]s were used to pay cigarette taxes. From around 1937 to the 1940s, various postage stamps were handstamped '''EXCISE''' or '''E''' for the same purpose. Between 1961 and 1964 various stamps were issued for Personal Tax. These exist with various roulettes, perforations and combinations of both.

Southern Rhodesia joined the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] and used its [[Revenue stamps of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|revenue stamps]] from 1953 to 1963.

==Rhodesia==
Following [[Rhodesia]]'s [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in November 1965, the country assumed independence and issued its first revenues a year later. They used the 1954 Southern Rhodesia design but with altered inscriptions. One of the values - the 6d red and black - is very rare despite it being one of the most commonly used rates as it was the stamp duty tax on cheques. Its rarity is probably because old stocks of Southern Rhodesian revenues continued to be used instead of it. In 1970 the set was reissued denominated in [[Rhodesian dollar]]s. There were some provisional surcharges made in 1980 just before the country was renamed Zimbabwe.

==Zimbabwe==
[[File:Zimbabwe revenue stamps in blocks of four.jpg|thumb|Modern Zimbabwean revenues in blocks of four]]
In 1980, Rhodesia was renamed Zimbabwe following the end of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|civil war]]. Initially it used Rhodesian revenues with the name obliterated by hand in ink, but in 1981 a new design showing the [[Zimbabwe Bird]] was issued. Since around 2000 perforated stamps were withdrawn and replaced by rouletted issues on coloured paper. Due to inflation, these have values up to $200,000.

==Northern Rhodesia==
[[Northern Rhodesia]] became a separate protectorate in 1924, and it issued its first revenue stamps a year later with values from £2 to £50. These portrayed [[King George V]] and showed a local scene with giraffes, elephants and other wildlife. These continued to be used until the 1950s. Postage stamps were used for revenue transactions of lower values. In 1953, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] postage stamps were overprinted with a large '''R''' indicating revenue use. About two years later, the 1925 King George V design was reissued with the portrait of the Queen, this time with values ranging from 1d to £50.

In the 1930s, various cigarette [[excise stamp]]s were also issued, and an employment stamp featuring the [[Coat of arms of Zambia|coat of arms]] was issued around 1962.

Northern Rhodesia joined the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] and used its [[Revenue stamps of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|revenue stamps]] from 1953 to 1963.

==Zambia==
Following the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland#Dissolution|dissolution of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] in 1963, Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia in 1964. Its first revenues were issued in 1964 and depicted the [[Coat of arms of Zambia|coat of arms]]. The design was reissued in 1968 denominated in the [[Zambian kwacha]].

Revenue stamps of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,"[[File:Revenue stamp Rhodesia & Nyasaland 1956.jpg|thumb|A 1956 5/- revenue stamp of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]

The '''[[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]''' was a short lived semi-independent state in southern [[Africa]] that existed from 1953 to the end of 1963. The state comprised the former self-governing colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] and the [[British Empire|British]] protectorates of  [[Northern Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]]. It issued its own revenue stamps from around 1953 to 1955, and these were withdrawn after the federation ceased to exist.

In 1953 or 1954 a numeral design simply inscribed RHODESIA AND NYASALAND REVENUE and the value was issued. Nine values were issued in all, ranging from 6d to £5. None of these are common, and the high values are particularly scarce. In 1955, the Federation issued three [[excise stamp]]s for use on cigarette packets. These are quite rare as they were usually torn when used.<ref name=""barefoot""/>

}}</ref> Some African nations such as [[Zambia]] have a vast internal consumer demand for second-hand clothes or hand-me-downs from rich nations in North America and Europe. The clothes arrive in these local markets in large bales or packages and are then cut open so buyers can sort through them and pick what article they like the most.

The salaula industry faces many criticisms. One is that it tends to disturb the internal textile industry. Local textile business cannot compete with cheap used clothes coming from abroad. Defendants of the industry argue that market demand should dictate what is fair or not. 

Another criticism is towards the profit companies are generating from these clothes since these clothes were originally donated to non-profit organizations such as [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]]. Defendants of the practice argue that non-profit organization must sell these donations in order to acquire money necessary to fund their social projects.

[[Image:ZambianSchool4.JPG|right|thumb|The interior of a rural Zambian primary school]]
Lower '''education in [[Zambia]]''' is divided into three levels and these are namely: primary, junior secondary and upper secondary. Higher education in Zambia has improved in the recent years due to the increase of private universities and colleges. The biggest university is the public [[University of Zambia]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home {{!}} University of Zambia|url=https://www.unza.zm/|website=unza.zm|access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref> which is located in the capital city of Lusaka along the [[Great East Road]] and hosts a number of local and international students. The [[Copperbelt University]] is the second largest public university and is located in the [[Copperbelt Province|Copperbelt province]] of Zambia in [[Kitwe]], and the youngest public university is [[Mulungushi University]], with its main campus 26 km north of [[Kabwe]]. There are many other smaller universities, both public and private including the following: [[Texila American University Zambia|Texila American University]], [[Zambian Open University|Zambia Open University]], [[European University Zambia]] Zambia Catholic University, Cavendish University, [[Zambia Adventist University]], [[Northrise University]], [[University of Lusaka]], [[Lusaka Apex Medical University]], [[Woodlands University College]], Copperstone University College, University of Barotseland, University of Africa, [[Information and Communication University]], [[Kwame Nkrumah University]] of Education, Chalimbana University, Rusangu University, Robert Makasa University, Zambia Centre of Accountancy Studies and there are various Health training Institutes offering Diplomas in clinical medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Registered Private HEIs|url=https://www.hea.org.zm/index.php/registered-private-heis2|website=hea.org.zm|access-date=24 May 2020|archive-date=19 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919191005/https://hea.org.zm/index.php/registered-private-heis2|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Primary Education in Zambia is the foundation of every one who gets into school, going from grade 1 – 7 with students then expected to pass the exams set by the [[Examination Council of Zambia]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Examinations Council of Zambia {{!}} An Examining Body of Excellence|url=https://www.exams-council.org.zm/|language=en-US|access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref> at the end of the grade 7 school year. 
Primary schools are spread in all parts of the country. Zambia has close to 110 [[Districts]].  Primary schools are owned by the government, the private sector and communities. Teachers work there voluntarily or for small stipends, unless these schools are sponsored by charities. Some community schools charge significant fees and resemble low-end private schools, but most are very cheap and cater to pupils for whom the local government school is too far away or imposes unaffordable costs such as uniforms.

With the exception of a few top private schools, Zambian schools are chronically under-resourced and educational standards extremely low.

Schooling falls into the following levels:
* ECE, preschool and reception
* Primary, grades 1–7
* Junior Secondary, grades 8–9
* Senior Secondary, grades 10–12

Upon completion of primary school, you can hopefully get directly into a secondary school (Secondary schools offer education from grade 8–12)- unfortunately there are areas in Zambia that have no secondary schools. Efforts have been made and they have basic schools. Traditionally, grades 8–9 were part of Basic school. This allowed pupils unable to access secondary school to continue their schooling up to Grade 9, and provides primary schools with additional income (as government schools are allowed to charge fees to Gardes 8 and 9).
In rural areas some pupils move long distances to access primary education and this has been a disadvantage in the fight to educating the [[future generation]].

=== Education system ===
[[File:A classroom of children from rural homes.jpg|thumb|A classroom of children from rural homes]]
The Education system in Zambia is that of four levels:

====Early Childhood Education level====
* Preschool.
* Reception. (no National exam.)

====Primary level====
* Grade 1 to 7.
* Education at this level is free at all governments schools. (National exam.)

====Junior Secondary school ====
* Grade 8 to 9.
* Theoretically free but many requirements

====Senior Secondary====

* Grade 10 to 12.
* Education at this level is free at all governments schools and grant aided schools as of 2022.
* Education system GCSE.
* ASAT at grade 9

==Higher education==
In Zambia, there are three government universities and several technical schools that provide higher education. The Ministry of Science Technology and Vocational Training (MSTVT) in Zambia was also developed in 1992 to foster growth in technological fields.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2019-03-13|title=Higher Education in Zambia {{!}} K12 Academics|url=https://www.k12academics.com/Higher%20Education%20Worldwide/higher-education-zambia|access-date=2021-05-19|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Kelly |first=M.

After secondary school, students mostly study at the various colleges around the country. Normally they all select students on the basis of ability; competition for places is intense. 

The introduction of fees in the late 1990s has made university level education inaccessible for some, although the government does theoretically provide state [[bursar]]ies. Copperbelt University opened in the late 1980s, taking over most of the former Zambia [[Institute of Technology]] site in Kitwe.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bettycdriscoll|date=2013-07-15|title=Zambia: Education|url=http://zambiass.blogspot.com/2013/07/education.html|access-date=2021-05-19|website=Zambia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Carmody |first=Brendan Patrick |title=The evolution of education in Zambia |date=2004 |publisher=Bookworld Publishers |isbn=9982-24-027-7 |location=Lusaka, Zambia |oclc=60359713}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Explore the Network|url=https://www.4icu.org/reviews/4918.htm|website=4icu.org/reviews/4918.htm|access-date=29 May 2020}}</ref> There are also several teacher training colleges offering two-year training programmes, while mission hospitals around the country offer internationally acceptable training for nurses. Several Christian schools offer seminary-level training.

There are three main universities and several others: 
* [[University of Zambia]] (UNZA)
* [[Copperbelt University]] (CBU)
* [[Mulungushi University]] (MU)
* [[Texila American University Zambia]] (TAU)
* DMI St. Eugene University (DMISEU)
* [[University of Lusaka]] (UNILUS)
* [[Rusangu University]] (RU)
* [[Cavendish University Zambia]] (CUZ)
* Lusaka Apex Medical University (LAMU)
* [[Zambia Open University]] (ZOU)
* [[Woodlands University College]]
* [[Kwame Nkrumah University]] (KWANU)
* University of Africa (UOA)
* University of Barotseland
* [[Information and Communication University]] (ICU)
* [[Mukuni University]] (MU)
* Eden University
* Kitwe College University of Education
* Africa Research University (ARU)

Additional Centres of Higher Education:

Apart from this universities and colleges, the country has also one of the oldest college offering distance education. '''[[Zambia College of Distance Education (ZACODE)]] formerly National Correspondence College''' has been in existence since 1963. The College had started from Evelyn Hone College then transferred from Lusaka to Luanshya. The college used to have 30000 learners and current crop of leaders in various institutions benefited from the materials the college produced and has continued to produce. Colleges and universities offering distance education must engage the college to help them improve on the distance materials being offered so that they become interactive.

'''Fiwale Hill''' is a distinctive hill located in [[Zambia]], notable as a geographical landmark and the namesake for significant community infrastructure, including Fiwale Hill Hospital, Fiwale Hill School, and Fiwale Hill Church.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/>

==Current infrastructure and facilities==
The area immediately surrounding Fiwale Hill is home to community facilities that serve the local population.

===Fiwale Hill Hospital===
The '''Fiwale Hill Hospital''' see in the photo was built in 1954 by Harold Creasey. The hospital then developed into the Fiwale Hill Leprosy Settlement, which officially opened in 1956. By 1960, it had become the primary facility for the treatment of all leprosy patients in Zambia. A training course for leprosy control officers was also opened at Fiwale Hill in 1963.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/> Today, the hospital provides for services for the residents of and surrounding communities. The hospital provides access to medical attention (e.g. general healthcare, maternal and child health services, outpatient care, emergency services, etc.) in the region.<ref name=""LeprosyHistory""/><ref name=""Barnes1999""/>
[[File:Fiwale Hill Hospital Zambia.jpg|thumb|Fiwale Hill Hospital Zambia]]

===Fiwale Hill School===
Adjacent to the hospital is the '''Fiwale Hill School''', an educational institution that caters to the local youth. The school, which opened in 1958, provided primary education and by 1963 had 200 pupils.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/> Currently, the school provides for students from Fiwale Hill and surrounding villages.

===Fiwale Hill Church===
The '''Fiwale Hill Church''' serves as the spiritual center of the Fiwale Hill Mission. Established as part of the initial mission station in 1954, it has been instrumental in the religious life of the community. Notably, the church incorporates [[Norman architecture]] elements, including its distinctive rounded arches, which are a characteristic feature of this style of construction, as seen in structures like [[St Swithun's Church, Nately Scures]] in England. The use of such arches in building provides structural support and allows for wide, durable openings, contributing to the church's stability and design. The church has historically played a significant role in training and equipping local church leaders and evangelists, working alongside resident missionaries.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/><ref name=""Dube2007""/>
[[File:Fiwali Hill Church Zambia.jpg|thumb|Fiwali Hill Church Zambia]]

==History and development==
The development of Fiwale Hill as a center for community services was advanced in 1954, when the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] (BMS) agreed to support the mission station there. This initiative was intended as a rural centre for leprosy work, general medical services, and education.<ref name=""Dube2007""/> The subsequent infrastructure development of the mission was led by Harold Creasey, a London businessman with considerable engineering skills. During the 13 years Creasey lived at Fiwale Hill, he continued to campaign in Britain for the development of Fiwale Hill in what was then [[Northern Rhodesia]].<ref name=""Barnes1999""/>

==Notable people from Fiwale Hill==
Fiwale Hill and its surrounding area have been associated with individuals who have achieved broader recognition.

One such figure is '''[[Howard Mwikuta]]''' (1941–2022), a prominent Zambian international footballer and coach. Mwikuta, born near Fiwale Hill in 1941, went on to have a distinguished career playing for the [[Zambia national football team|Zambia national team]] and notable clubs such as [[Mufulira Wanderers F.C.]] in Zambia and the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in the United States.

{{Politics of Zambia}}

The '''Ministry of Higher Education''' was a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Zambia]]. It oversaw university and vocational, training, science, technology and innovation and was headed by the Minister of Higher Education.

The ministry was established in 2005 after being split from the Ministry of Education, which was renamed the [[Ministry of General Education]].<ref>[http://www.mohe.gov.zm/?page_id=518 About us] Ministry of Higher Education</ref> It had existed previously as the Ministry of Science, Technology and Vocational Training. Prior to that, there had been a Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Education responsible for technical education.

After the [[2021 Zambian general election|2021 general elections]] the Ministry of Higher Education was merged with the [[Ministry of General Education]], restoring a single Ministry of Education.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parley approves turning gender ministry into Office of the President dept, among other changes |url=https://diggers.news/local/2021/09/15/parley-approves-turning-gender-ministry-into-office-of-the-president-dept-among-other-changes|date=15 September 2021 |access-date=2 November 2024 |website=Zambia: News Diggers! |language=en-GB}}</ref>

The '''[[climate]] of [[Zambia]]''' in [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] is definitely [[tropical]] modified by [[elevation|altitude (elevation)]]. In the [[Köppen climate classification]], most of the country is classified as '''''humid subtropical''''' or '''''tropical wet and dry''''', with small patches of '''''semi-arid steppe''''' climate in the south-west.

Climate and specifically rainfall amount is the chief determinant of type and distribution of the [[ecoregions of Zambia]]. So technically, Zambia is a very arid country with a humid and subtropical year with small patches of semi arid steppe.

==Seasons==
There are two main seasons: the [[rainy season]] (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the [[dry season]] (May to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant [[subtropical]] weather rather than tropical conditions for most of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia Seasons {{!}} Weather in Zambia - VentureCo Worldwide|url=https://www.ventureco-worldwide.com/zambia-seasons-weather-in-zambia/|website=Venture Co Worldwide|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-30|archive-date=2020-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001080339/https://www.ventureco-worldwide.com/zambia-seasons-weather-in-zambia/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Rainy season===
[[Rainfall]] varies over a range of {{convert|500|to|1400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year (most areas fall into the range of {{convert|700|to|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The distinction between rainy and dry seasons is marked with no rain at all falling in June, July and August. Much of the economic, cultural and social life of the country is dominated by the onset and end of the rainy season, and the amount of rain it brings. Failure of the rains causes hunger in most cases. The average temperature in Zambia in the summer season is 30&nbsp;°C and in the winter (colder season) it can get as low as 5&nbsp;°C. The rains are brought by the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) and are characterised by [[thunderstorm]]s, occasionally severe, with much [[lightning]] and sometimes hail. The ITCZ is located north of Zambia in the dry season. It moves southwards in the second half of the year, and northwards in the first half of the year. In some years, it moves south of Zambia, leading to a ""little dry season"" in the north of the country for three or four weeks in December.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The highest rainfall is in the north, especially the north-west and the north-east, decreasing towards the south; the driest areas are in the far south west and the [[Luangwa River]] and middle [[Zambezi River]] valleys, parts of which are considered semi-arid. None of the country is considered [[arid]] or to be [[desert]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Flooding is an annual event on [[floodplain]]s, to which people and wildlife are adapted. Flash floods after unusually heavy rain cause damage when they occur in places that do not experience annual floods. Erosion and the washing out of roads and bridges are common. Crops are frequently damaged by flooding and hail. Too much rain when the [[maize]] crop is flowering or late in the season when it should be drying off prior to harvest, can be very damaging and promotes rotting of stored grain.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=April 10|last2=Denchak|first2=2019 Melissa|title=Flooding and Climate Change: Everything You Need to Know|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flooding-and-climate-change-everything-you-need-know|access-date=2021-05-19|website=NRDC|language=en}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Dry season===

====Plant and animal adaptations====
[[Deciduous tree]]s which lose leaves in the dry season to conserve water predominate over [[evergreen]]s which have waxy [[plant cuticle|leaf cuticle]]s for the same purpose. The deciduous trees usually produce fresh green or reddish leaves just before the rainy season. Grasses and some other [[herbaceous plant]]s dry up above ground but regenerate quickly with the onset of rains from roots and tubers, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Climate of Zambia - By The Zambian For Zambia|date=6 January 2012 |url=https://thezambian.com/online/climate-of-zambia/|access-date=2021-05-19|language=en-US}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Except for those living in areas of permanent freshwater, animals are adapted to the long dry season, as seen in migration and breeding patterns.

====Bushfires====
In the middle to late dry season, [[bushfire]]s are prevalent, and smoke is noticeable by smell and as a haze. The fires are ignited by villagers hunting, burning crop residue, and preparing [[shifting cultivation|chitemene]] gardens; or by lightning in the early rainy season. Because such fires happen annually, there is no great buildup of dry fuel in the bush, and so the fires are not usually devastating. They may kill animals, and damage crops if the rains end early and fires happen before harvest. The presence of fire-adapted plants and [[palaeoecology|palaeoecological]] studies indicate that such fires have happened for millennia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====Water sources in the dry season====
Most rivers, lakes and swamps, except in the far south and south-west, are permanent. In addition, [[dambo]]s (grasslands which become [[marsh]]y in the rainy season) are prevalent in most of the country and water is usually available in them from [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s or shallow [[water well|well]]s. Dambos also release groundwater to streams and rivers towards the end of the dry season, keeping them flowing permanently. Small earth [[dam]]s are often constructed in dambos as a source of water and as fishponds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

For the human population, the location of rural settlements is determined by access to water in the dry season (though [[borehole]]s are now commonly used to augment supplies). Traditionally, people have also [[transhumance|migrated]] in the drier areas where rivers dambos are not prevalent. In [[Barotseland]], people move with their livestock, grazing them on the [[Barotse Floodplain]] in the dry season and moving to higher ground at the margins during the rainy season.<ref>{{Cite web|title=which specific area in zambia usually has relief rainfall|url=https://luisrasquilha.pro.br/k9ql5/5194db-which-specific-area-in-zambia-usually-has-relief-rainfall|access-date=2021-05-19|website=luisrasquilha.pro.br|archive-date=2021-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519091741/https://luisrasquilha.pro.br/k9ql5/5194db-which-specific-area-in-zambia-usually-has-relief-rainfall|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The ability to grow enough food in the rainy season to last the long dry season is also a factor in population distribution. Traditionally some communities have divided the year into farming in the rainy season, and fishing and hunting in the dry season, when herbivores can be found more easily as they visit sources of water, and fires can be set to expose them or drive them into traps.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bartzke|first1=Gundula S.|last2=Ogutu|first2=Joseph O.|last3=Mukhopadhyay|first3=Sabyasachi|last4=Mtui|first4=Devolent|last5=Dublin|first5=Holly T.|last6=Piepho|first6=Hans-Peter|date=2018-09-19|title=Rainfall trends and variation in the Maasai Mara ecosystem and their implications for animal population and biodiversity dynamics|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=9|pages=e0202814|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0202814|issn=1932-6203|pmc=6145597|pmid=30231048|bibcode=2018PLoSO..1302814B|doi-access=free}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Temperature==
The elevation of the [[African superswell|great plateau]] on which Zambia is located, typically between {{convert|1000|and|1300|m|ft|0}}, modifies temperatures, which are lower than for coastal areas at the same [[latitude]], and pleasant for much of the year. On the plateau (covering about 80% of the country) temperature ranges, depending on location are:

Most of the country is frost-free but in some years ground [[frost]] occurs. This is restricted to the highest exposed hills, or more widely in the lower humidity areas of the southernmost parts of the country.

Temperatures are higher at lower [[elevation]]s, such as the [[Luapula River|Luapula]]-[[Lake Mweru|Mweru]] and [[Lake Mweru Wantipa|Mweru Wantipa]]/[[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] valleys in the north, and highest in the lower Luangwa and Zambezi valleys in the south, typically experiencing {{convert|40|°C}} in October, with rising humidity making for uncomfortable conditions.

During the rainy season months of November to April or May some days may be [[Humidity|humid]], but daily maximum temperatures are usually a little lower than in the hot dry season. The rain can be cooling, unlike in the humid tropics.

==Wind==
Prevailing winds in the dry season are generally moderate, but occasionally more severe and may bring cool dust-laden air from distant arid regions. [[Whirlwind]]s are very common but not usually destructive. [[Waterspouts]] can be seen over lakes.

In the rainy season, winds are localised with thunderstorms and may be destructive but usually confined to small areas, such as blowing roofs off buildings. The country does not suffer [[tornado]]es or [[cyclone]]s of widespread destructive force.

==Climate change==
Zambia is considered to be [[Climate change vulnerability|vulnerable to climate change]]. The main impact pathway of climate change in the country is through increasing variability in rainfall amounts during the agricultural season across the various agroecological regions, and shifts in the duration of the rainy season.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Government of the Republic of Zambia |title=National Policy on Climate Change |publisher=Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection |year=2016 |location=Lusaka, Zambia |language=English}}</ref> Zambia is considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because the majority of the population rely on agriculture for their [[livelihood]]s - and changes in rainfall patterns has a negative impact due to the [[Rainfed agriculture|rainfed]] nature of production. Researched evidence suggested that temperature was likely to increase by 1.82<sup>o</sup>C and rainfall reduce by 0.87 percentage points by 2050.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ngoma|first1=Hambulo|last2=Lupiya|first2=Patrick|last3=Kabisa|first3=Mulako|last4=Hartley|first4=Faaiqa|date=2021|title=Impacts of climate change on agriculture and household welfare in Zambia: an economy-wide analysis|journal=Climatic Change|volume=167|issue=3–4|page=55|doi=10.1007/s10584-021-03168-z|bibcode=2021ClCh..167...55N|s2cid=221707009|issn=0165-0009|doi-access=free}}</ref> This means that the occurrence of extreme climate events such as [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s would become more frequent.<ref>Kalantary, C.

In March 2025, US President [[Donald Trump]] canceled a USD 250,000 [[USAID]] grant to Zambia, dedicated to fighting climate change by promoting [[veganism]] and [[sustainable agriculture]] (for example [[agroforestry]] and [[permaculture]]). The plan included educational, business and governmental measures, respecting the cultural and agriculture landscsape of Zambia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Trump Cancels Support for Vegan Climate Action Plan in Zambia |url=https://zambianobserver.com/trump-cancels-support-for-vegan-climate-action-plan-in-zambia/ |access-date=13 April 2025 |agency=Zambia Observer |date=5 March 2025}}</ref>

Zambia is potentially self-sufficient in sources of electricity, coal, [[biomass]] and [[renewable energy]]. The only energy source where the country is not [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]] is [[Petroleum|petroleum energy]]. Many of the sources of energy where the country is self-sufficient are largely unexploited.<ref name=""One"">{{cite web|date=25 May 2016 | url=https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/an-overview-of-the-energy-sector/ |title=An overview of the energy sector |access-date=21 April 2018 |newspaper=[[Zambia Daily Mail]] |first=Margaret |last=Chimase |location=Lusaka}}</ref> As of 2017, the country's electricity generating capacity stood at 1,901 megawatts.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2017-03-29|title=Zambia : Zambia's Electricity Generation Capacity Increases to 1,901MW'|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2017/03/29/zambias-electricity-generation-capacity-increases-1901mw/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-10|website=Lusaka Times|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Overview==
{{asof|2016}}, it was estimated that 28 percent of [[Zambia]]'s population had access to electricity, with 62 percent of the [[Urban area|urban population]] and 5 percent of the rural population having access. At that time, about 500,000 urban households and approximately 1.8 million rural households did not have access to electricity.<ref name=""Two"">{{cite web|url=https://www.africa-eu-renewables.org/market-information/zambia/energy-sector/ | title=Zambia: Energy Sector |access-date=21 April 2018 | date=2016 |publisher=Africa-EU-Renewables.org | author=Africa-EU-Renewables}}</ref> It is estimated that electricity demand in the country is growing at about 3 percent annually.<ref name=""Three"">{{cite web| url=http://www.zda.org.zm/?q=content/energy |

There are three power producing and distribution companies in Zambia; (a) [[ZESCO|Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited]] (ZESCO), a government-owned company (b) Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Limited and (c) Ndola Energy. [[ZESCO]], the largest of the three owns and maintains 94.7 percent (2306/2434) of installed [[hydropower]] capacity, as of 2016.<ref name=""Two""/>

==Hydroelectricity==
As of 2022, the country had {{convert|3456|MW}} of installed hydropower capacity against a peak national demand of {{convert|2300|MW}}, resulting in a surplus of 1000MW which is exported to the Central and Southern African region. Zambia has an estimated {{convert|6000|MW}} of untapped hydropower potential. Hydroelectricity constitutes 90 percent of Zambia's electricity generation pool.<ref name=""Three-and-a-bit"">{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/21/zambias-zesco-declares-1000-mw-surplus-in-power-generation-is-it-now-time-to-accelerate-ev-adoption/ |title=Zambia's ZESCO Declares 1,000 MW Surplus in Power Generation — Is It Now Time To Accelerate EV Adoption? |date=21 July 2022 |publisher=Clean Technica}}</ref> Several existing large hydro facilities are currently being upgraded. Some of the new large hydropower projects in the pipeline include the 2,400 megawatts [[Batoka Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station|Batoka Gorge]] Hydroelectric Power Station and the 1,000 megawatts Luapula Hydroelectric Power Station. Substantial untapped hydropower potential exists for small scale rural electrification projects.<ref name=""Four"">{{cite web|url=https://www.africa-eu-renewables.org/market-information/zambia/renewable-energy-potential/ |title=Zambia: Renewable source Potential |date=2016 |

==Thermal power==
There are three grid-ready [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] stations. The {{convert|50|MW}} [[heavy fuel oil]] plant owned by Ndola Energy, the six [[Gas turbine|gas turbines]] with combined capacity of  {{convert|80|MW}} owned by the [[Copperbelt Energy Corporation]] and the Maamba Coal power plant with a capacity of {{convert|300|MW}}.<ref name=""Two""/><ref name=""Three-and-a-bit""/>

Zambia has proven coal reserves of at least 80,000,000 tonnes in the country's [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Province]]. Potential reserves exist elsewhere in the county, although the size of that potential has not yet been quantified.<ref name=""One""/>

==Oil and natural gas==
Although Zambia has no proven commercial deposits of oil, the country hosts an oil refinery, the ''[[Indeni Petroleum Refinery]]'', a 24,000 [[Barrel|barrels]]-a-day facility, based in [[Ndola]], in the [[Copperbelt Province]].<ref name=""Five"">{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/glencore-vitol-bid-for-stake-in-zambia-s-sole-oil-refinery |title=Glencore, Vitol Bid for Stake in Zambia's Sole Oil Refinery |date=16 March 2018 |access-date=21 April 2018 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg LP]] |last=Taonga Clifford Mitimingi |first=and Paul Burkhardt}}</ref><ref name=""Six"">{{cite web|title=Zambia Short-Lists Five Firms For Majority Stake In Oil Refinery |date=16 April 2018 |access-date=21 April 2018 | url=https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/zambia_shortlists_five_firms_for_majority_stake_in_oil_refinery-16-apr-2018-154264-article/ |publisher=Rigzone.com Quoting [[Reuters]] |last=Chris Mfula | first=and James Macharia}}</ref>

==Renewable energy==
Zambia has a diversity of potential sources of renewable energy, such as its abundant water resources for hydropower generation. Renewable energy development in the country is supported by a renewable energy strategy and a national climate change response strategy that promote low emissions, as well as the implementation of [[sustainable land management]] practices.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/988zambia.pdf|title=National Report—Zambia: The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Hydropower accounts for 85 percent of the country's total installed capacity, while there is a potential to increase production from wind and photovoltaic energy systems.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-09|title=Discussing climate change and renewable energy in Zambia|url=https://energycentral.com/c/enelfoundation/discussing-climate-change-and-renewable-energy-zambia|access-date=2021-01-10|website=Energy Central|language=en}}</ref>

As of April 2016, the peak electricity demand outstripped peak energy production by 560 megawatts. The government, ZESCO, [[civil society]] and other stakeholders are exploring opportunities in the

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Zambia}}
Zambia has a [[tropical]] [[climate]], modified by the altitude of the country. There is a rainy season that runs from October/November to March/April.[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map ZMB present.svg|thumb|220x220px|Köppen climate classification map of Zambia|left]]
===Terrain===
The terrain of Zambia is mostly high [[plateau]], with some hills and [[mountain]]s. The lowest point is the [[Zambezi]] river, at {{convert|329|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, with the highest being [[Mafinga Central]] in the [[Mafinga Hills]], at {{convert|2339|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. 

Zambia is a landlocked country bordered along [[Zimbabwe]] in the south divided by [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], [[Congo DR]] in the north, [[Tanzania]] on the northeast, [[Malawi]] on the east and [[Mozambique]] on the southeast. The general topography of the country is characterized by uplifted [[planation surface]]s. The general elevation of the nation as a whole is tended towards west to east from the [[Kalahari Basin]]. The level of land falls from the upper Congo towards the Zambezi depression in the South forming a plateau.<ref>{{cite web|title= Geography of Zambia|url=http://www.zambiatourism.com/about-zambia/geography|year=2011|access-date=19 October 2016|publisher=Zambia Tourism Board}}</ref>

Zambia lies in the watershed between DR Congo and Zambezi river systems. Leaving two provinces, all other provinces lie in the country frontier formed between the continental divide separating the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, which traverses from DR Congo to the south of Tanzania. There are three major seasons: a cool dry season from April to August, a hot dry season from August to November and a warm wet season from November to April.

==Environment==

[[File:Victoriafälle.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Victoria Falls]]]]Current issues for the environment in the country include: [[air pollution]] and resulting [[acid rain]] in the [[mineral]] extraction and refining region; chemical runoff into watersheds; poaching, which seriously threatens: rhinoceros, elephant, antelope, and large cat populations; [[deforestation]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]] and lack of adequate water treatment, which presents human health risks.

Zambia is considered to be [[Climate change vulnerability|vulnerable to climate change]]. The main impact pathway of climate change in the country is through increasing variability in rainfall amounts during the agricultural season across the various agroecological regions, and shifts in the duration of the rainy season.<ref>{{Cite book |first= |title=National Policy on Climate Change |publisher=Ministry of Lands, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection |year=2016 |location=Lusaka, Zambia |language=English}}</ref> Zambia is considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because the majority of the population rely on agriculture for their [[livelihood]]s - and changes in rainfall patterns has a negative impact due to the [[Rainfed agriculture|rainfed]] nature of production. Researched evidence suggested that temperature was likely to increase by 1.82<sup>o</sup>C and rainfall reduce by 0.87 percentage points by 2050.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ngoma|first1=Hambulo|last2=Lupiya|first2=Patrick|last3=Kabisa|first3=Mulako|last4=Hartley|first4=Faaiqa|date=2021|title=Impacts of climate change on agriculture and household welfare in Zambia: an economy-wide analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03168-z|journal=Climatic Change|volume=167|issue=3–4|page=55|doi=10.1007/s10584-021-03168-z|bibcode=2021ClCh..167...55N|s2cid=221707009|issn=0165-0009|doi-access=free}}</ref> This means that the occurrence of [[Extreme weather|extreme climate events]] such as [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s would become more frequent.<ref>Kalantary, C.

Zambia is party to the following international agreements: [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Nuclear Test Ban]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]] and [[Wetlands]]. Zambia has signed, but not ratified, the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of Zambia, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point: Cape Pungu, [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern province]]
* Easternmost point: Kongula Peak, Northern province
* Southernmost point: unnamed location on the border with Zimbabwe in the Zambezi river, [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern province]]
* Westernmost point: the western section of the border with Angola (Zambia does not have a westernmost point as the border here is formed by the line of [[longitude]] 22° E)

The '''Barotse Floodplain,''' <!--PLEASE NOTE ""Barotse Floodplain"" is used as a proper name with initial cap on Floodplain as per map/atlas references given-->also known as the '''Bulozi Plain''', '''Lyondo''' or the '''Zambezi Floodplain,''' is one of Africa's great [[Zambezian flooded grasslands|wetland]]s, on the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] in the [[Western Province, Zambia|Western Province]] of [[Zambia]]. It is a designated [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar site]], regarded as being of high conservation value.<ref>[http://www.wetlands.org/reports/ris/1ZM007_2007.pdf ""Zambezi Floodplain Ramsar Information Sheet""] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150707/http://www.wetlands.org/reports/ris/1ZM007_2007.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}, in ''Ramsar Sites Information Service'', [[Wetlands International]]. Retrieved 22 November 2007.</ref>

The name recognises the [[floodplain]] as spawning the culture and way of life of the [[Lozi people]], ""Rotse"" being a variant of ''Lozi'', and ""Ba"" meaning ""people"". They became a powerful kingdom in [[Central Africa|Central]]/[[Southern Africa]] under their king or [[litunga]] [[Lewanika]], whose realm extended up to 300&nbsp;km from the plain and was called [[Barotseland]].

==Topography and area==
The region is a flat [[plateau]] at an elevation of about 1000&nbsp;m, tilting very slightly to the south. The Zambezi and its [[River source|headwaters]] rise on the higher ground to the north, which enjoys good rainfall (1400&nbsp;mm annually) in a [[rainy season]] from October to May. A flood moves down the river, reaching a flat region formed from [[Kalahari]] sands, about five hundred kilometres across. To the south, around the [[Ngonye Falls]], harder rock is found at the surface and has resisted the river's tendency to cut a channel down into it, and so acts a bit like a dam. Behind it, the floodplain has formed. Below the falls, the river flows nearly twice as fast as it does on the plain and flows more swiftly in a narrower valley less prone to flooding.

The floodplain stretches from the Zambezi's [[confluence]] with the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]] and [[Lungwebungu River]]s in the north, to a point about 230&nbsp;km south, above the Ngonye falls and south of [[Senanga]]. Along most of its length its width is over 30&nbsp;km, reaching 50&nbsp;km at the widest, just north of [[Mongu]], principal town of the plain, situated at its edge. The main body of the plain covers about 5500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=""IUCN"">[http://www.cbd.int/doc/case-studies/inc/cs-inc-iucn-12-en.pdf ""Barotse Floodplain, Zambia: local economic dependence on wetland resources.""] ''Case Studies in Wetland Valuation #2'': IUCN, May 2003.</ref>
but the maximum flooded area is 10 750&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> when the floodplains of several tributaries are taken into account,<ref name=""FAO"">[http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/n0084e/N0084E03.htm Welcomme, R.L. (Comp.) (1979): ”The inland fisheries of Africa.""] CIFA Occas.Pap., (7): 69 p. Published by Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, Rome.</ref> such as the [[Luena River, Western Zambia|Luena Flats]]. The Barotse Floodplain is the second largest wetland in Zambia after the [[Lake Bangweulu]] system, which differs in having a large permanent lake and swamps, and a much smaller area which dries out annually.<ref name=""IUCN""/>

The satellite photo was taken in April 2004 at the peak of the flood, Note that the northern part of the plain, near Lukulu, is less flooded, the land there varies a bit more in height and the water tends to keep to the many river channels.

==Flood levels and timing==
:''See also [[Climate of Zambia]]
The peak of the [[flood]] occurs on the floodplain about 3 months after the peak of the rainy season in January–February. The flood usually peaks in April, and recedes in May to July, when grasses quickly grow on the exposed plain. At the river's lowest water in November the floodplain still contains about 537&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of [[lagoon]]s, [[swamp]]s and channels.<ref name=""FAO""/> The flood leaves behind a fertile grey to black soil overlaying the Kalahari sands, enriched by [[silt]] deposited by the flood as well as [[humus]] from vegetation killed by the initial flood, and from decaying aquatic plants left to dry out in the mud. It provides a good soil, but in the late dry season it bakes hard in the heat of the sun.<ref name=""IUCN""/>

As the floods recede, water is left behind in lagoons, swamps, and [[oxbow lake]]s.

==Natural environment==
The floodplain is in the [[Ecoregions of Zambia#Zambezian flooded grasslands|Zambezian flooded grasslands]] [[ecoregion]], and is bordered by slightly higher sandy ground on which grow dry grasslands ([[Ecoregions of Zambia#Western Zambezian grasslands|Western Zambezian grasslands]]) with woodland savanna ([[Ecoregions of Zambia#Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands|Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands]]) to the east and south, and patches of evergreen forest ([[Ecoregions of Zambia#Cryptosepalum dry forests|Cryptosepalum dry forests]]) in the north and east.

The flood provides [[aquatic habitat]]s for fish such as [[Hydrocynus|tigerfish]] and [[Serranochromis|bream]], [[Nile crocodile|crocodiles]], [[hippopotamus]], waterbirds, fish-eating birds, and [[lechwe]], the wading [[antelope]]. After the flood, the plain is a habitat for grazing animals such as [[wildebeest]], [[zebra]], [[tsessebe]] and small antelope such [[oribi]] and [[steenbok]], and their predators.<ref name=""IUCN""/>
These herbivores have been displaced in most areas by the cattle grazed by the Lozi, but they have provided a large game reserve on the dry grassland to the west, the [[Liuwa Plain National Park]], once the Litunga's hunting grounds, established as a game reserve by [[Lewanika]] in the 19th century. In addition the entire western of the Zambezi within the country is a Game Management Area.
[[File:Isolated human settlements on high ground in the Barotse Floodplain.jpg|thumb|390x390px|'''Isolated human settlements on high ground in the Barotse Floodplain, Zambezi River near Mongu city in Western province, Zambia.''']]

==Human ecology of the plain==
About 250,000 people live on the plain with a similar number of cattle, [[transhumance|migrating]] to grasslands at the edge of the floodplain when the flood arrives. The floodplain is one of the most productive areas for raising cattle in the country.<ref name=""IUCN""/>

The Lozi also catch fish, eating about five times as much as the national average. At the height of the flood they use [[fish traps]] and spears for fishing, and they use [[gill net]]s in the lagoons left behind by the falling flood. Fish [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] just before the flood, the first floodwaters are naturally [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (low in oxygen) which kills most fish, while eggs survive.<ref name=""IUCN""/>

The Lozi cultivate crops on the floodplain such as [[maize]], [[rice]], [[sweet potato]], and [[sugar cane]].

November to January are lean months.<ref name=""IUCN""/>
Stored produce from the previous growing season is almost used up and in any case would need to be transported during the migration, while the new season's crops and grasses are not yet productive, and at the same time fishing stops for the spawning season. Hunting and trapping animals, which might have filled the gap, is no longer available to most people, and trapping waterbirds is one of the few alternatives to buying flour.

The floodplain determines and dominates the way of life, economy, society and culture of the Lozi, who are skilled boat-builders, paddlers and swimmers.<ref name=""IUCN""/>
The annual migration with the flood is celebrated in the [[Kuomboka]] ceremony held at Mongu, capital of Barotseland and its successor, the Western Province.

In the occasional very wet year such as 2005, lives and property are lost in floods on the Barotse Plain. More often, however, it is a very good example of the principle that natural annual flooding by rivers is valuable and productive for wildlife and human populations, while damming rivers to control floods, as has happened with the [[Kafue Flats]], is potentially damaging to the environment.

===Development===
Development on the plain has been restricted until now to— 
* the [[canal]] dug in [[Northern Rhodesia|colonial times]] to connect a small harbour at Mongu to the Zambezi's channel in the dry season
*small villages and [[Compound (enclosure)|compounds]] constructed on mounds, such as Lealui
*a few dry season tracks
*[[pontoon ferry|pontoon ferries]] at Sandaula, Libonda and Lukulu
* some intensive rice and sugarcane plantations.

Tight control over access to the floodplain by the Litunga and the homogeneity of the indigenous people have slowed commercial development by outsiders. 
====Barotse Floodplain causeway====<!--NOTE linked from Western province-->
{{See also|Lusaka–Mongu Road#Westwards extension}}
[[File:Bridge over the Barotse Floodplain near Mongu city aerial view.jpg|thumb|'''Bridge through the Barotse Floodplain at Mongu city, western province, Zambia.''']]
A new project, the '''[[Barotse Floodplain Causeway|Mongu-Kalabo road]]''', will have more far-reaching consequences. Around 2002 construction started of a 46-kilometre [[causeway]] across the centre of the floodplain to take a paved highway from [[Mongu]] to [[Kalabo]], via the ferry across the main river channel at Sandaula, which would then be replaced by a 500-metre bridge. It is treated as an extension of the [[Lusaka–Mongu Road|Lusaka-Mongu Road]] from [[Lusaka]]. Originally intended to be completed in 2006, it has been delayed by the difficulty of building on the floodplain. There is no rock in the region, and the causeway has been built from sand and gravel scooped out from shallow depressions next to it. Higher than usual floods washed away large sections. The contractor was a [[Kuwait]]-based company which acknowledged that conditions were difficult.<ref>[http://www.ccc.gr/PDF/Bulletin/Bulletin74.pdf Bulletin 74 (August 2004)], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150707/http://www.ccc.gr/PDF/Bulletin/Bulletin74.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }} [[Consolidated Contractors Company]] of Kuwait.</ref> The ''[[Times of Zambia]]'' reported that the company underestimated the floodplain environment, and abandoned the contract.<ref>[http://www.times.co.zm/news/archives.cgi?category=6&view=4.05.07-4.12.07 Sylvia Mweetwa: ""Road financiers to extend agreement.""]{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}Ndola: ''Times of Zambia'', 5 April 2007.</ref> Subsequent modifications have been made to raise the road height and to increase the number and size of [[culvert]]s, and this in turn led to funding problems. The road has been completed in 2016. A Chinese contractor, the [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China]] (AVIC International), finished the 286.9 million US dollars project.

Under the British colonial administration, Barotseland was a [[protectorate]] of the [[The Crown|British Crown]] from the late 19th-century. The Litunga, the monarch of Barotseland, had negotiated agreements, first with the [[British South African Company]] (BSAC), and then with the British government that ensured the kingdom maintained much of its traditional authority under the Litunga. Barotseland was essentially a nation-state, a protectorate within the larger protectorate of [[Northern Rhodesia]]. In return for this protectorate status, the [[Litunga]] gave the BSAC mineral exploration rights in Barotseland.<ref name=""gga.org"">{{cite web|title=All shook up: Zambia's president Michael Sata broke a 2011 campaign promise to restore the Barotseland kingdom's autonomy|publisher=Good Governance Africa|url=http://gga.org/stories/editions/aif-18-fault-lines-africas-separation-anxiety/all-shook-up|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084326/http://gga.org/stories/editions/aif-18-fault-lines-africas-separation-anxiety/all-shook-up|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1964, Barotseland became part of Zambia when that country achieved independence. In 2012, a group of traditional Lozi leaders, calling itself the Barotseland National Council, called for independence; other tribal chieftains oppose secession, however.<ref name=""BBCseeks""/>

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The origins of Barotseland are unclear, but are a prominent subject in [[Lozi mythology]]. It is believed that the Barotse state was founded by Queen [[Mbuywamwambwa]], the Lozi matriarch, over 500 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Caplan|first=Gerald L.|date=October 1968|title=Barotseland: the secessionist challenge to Zambia|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/barotseland-the-secessionist-challenge-to-zambia/267CAE95D7DCC846E37B06F130FFAAC6|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=343–360|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00017456|s2cid=153463371 |issn=1469-7777|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Its people were migrants from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]]. Other ethnic groupings that constitute the current Barotse kingdom migrated from [[South Africa]], [[Angola]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Namibia]] and [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]]. The Barotse (the Lozi) reached the Zambezi River in the 17th century and their kingdom grew until it comprised some 25 peoples from [[Southern Rhodesia]] to the Congo and from Angola to the [[Kafue River]]. At the time, Barotseland was already a monarchy, when [[Lealui]] and [[Limulunga]] were seasonal capitals of the Lozi kings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=UNPO: Barotseland|url=https://unpo.org/members/16714|website=unpo.org|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

In 1845 Barotseland had been conquered by the Makololo (Kololo) from Botswana<ref name=""Phiri"" /> – which is why the Barotse language, Silozi, is a variant of [[Tswana-Sotho languages|Setswana]]. The Makololo were in power when [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]] visited Barotseland, but after thirty years the Luyi successfully overthrew the Kololo king.<ref>{{cite book|first1= Lewis H.|last1= Gann|first2= Peter|last2= Duignan|year= 1999|title=Africa and the world: An introduction to the history of sub-Saharan Africa from antiquity to 1840 |publisher=University Press of America|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IWFOBb9rOgEC&pg=PA413 413–414]|isbn= 0-7618-1520-1}}</ref>

=== British colonisation ===
[[File:Seven Years in South Africa, page 220, king Sepopo.jpg|thumb|Sipopa Lutangu, king of the Lozi people in 1864–1876]]
Barotseland's status at the onset of the colonial era differed from the other regions which became Zambia. It was the first territory north of the Zambezi to sign a [[Mining rights|minerals concession]] and [[protectorate]] agreement with the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) of [[Cecil Rhodes]]. 

[[File:Seven Years in South Africa, page 357, Wana Wena, the new king of the Marutse.jpg|thumb|left|Mwanawina II, king of the Lozi people in 1876–1878]]
By 1880, the kingdom was stabilised and King Lewanika signed a treaty on 26 June 1889 to provide the kingdom international recognition as a State. After the discovery of diamonds, King Lewanika began trading with Europe. The first trade concession was signed on 27 June 1889 with Harry Ware, in return King Lewanika and his kingdom were to be protected. Ware transferred his concession to Cecil Rhodes of the British South Africa Company. Seeking the improvement of the military protection and with the intention to sign a treaty with the British Government, King Lewanika signed on 26 June 1890 the Lochner concession putting Barotseland under the protection of the British South Africa Company.  At that time, there was European administration in Southern Rhodesia, in Nyasaland further East, and the beginnings of European administration in what was then called North-Eastern Rhodesia (centred on Fort Jameson, now Chipata) and also North-Western Rhodesia - basically Barotseland. Later, these two were administratively combined as simply ""Northern Rhodesia"", later divided up in five Provinces and Barotseland, which was treated slightly differently from the rest.<ref name=""UPNO"" />

Later Lewanika protested to [[British Government|London]] and to [[Queen Victoria]] that the BSAC agents had misrepresented the terms of the concession,<ref>Lewanika wrote to Queen Victoria, ""My country is your blanket, and my people are the fleas in that blanket.""</ref> but his protests fell on deaf ears,<ref name=""ReferenceA""/> and in 1899 the United Kingdom proclaimed a protectorate and governed it as part of [[Barotziland–North-Western Rhodesia]].<ref name=""Spectrum"">Camerapix: ""Spectrum Guide to Zambia."" Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996.</ref>

=== Balovale Dispute ===
In the 1930s, there was trouble between the Barotse and the [[Lovale people|Balovale]] and [[Lunda people|Balunda]] tribes who occupied the land to the north of the land occupied by the Barotse. The Barotse claimed that these were vassal tribes, while they claimed that they were not. Eventually, the Government set up a Commission to adjudicate, and the Barotse lost.<ref name=""spanglefish.com"" />

=== Barotseland Agreement (1964) ===
On 18 May 1964, the Litunga and [[Kenneth Kaunda]], Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia, signed the ""Barotseland Agreement 1964""<ref>{{cite web|title=Barotseland Agreement 1964 Document|date=31 January 2011 |publisher=The Lusaka Times|url=http://www.lusakatimes.com/2011/01/31/barotseland-agreement-1964-document/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203035943/http://www.lusakatimes.com/2011/01/31/barotseland-agreement-1964-document|archive-date=3 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> which established Barotseland's position within Zambia in place of the earlier agreement between Barotseland and the British Government. The agreement was based on a long history of close social, economic and political interactions, but granted significant continued autonomy to Barotseland. The Barotseland Agreement granted Barotse authorities local self-governance rights and rights to be consulted on specified matters, including over land, natural resources and local government. It also established the Litunga of Barotseland as ""the principal local authority for the government and administration of Barotseland"", that he would remain in control of the ""Barotse Native Government"", the ""Barotse Native Authorities"", the courts known as the ""Barotse Native Courts"", ""matters relating to local government"", ""land"", ""forests"", ""fishing"", ""control of hunting"", ""game preservation"", the ""Barotse native treasury"", the supply of beer and ""local taxation"". There was also to be no appeal from Barotseland's courts to the courts of Zambia.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

Within a year of taking office as president of the newly independent Zambia on 24 October 1964, President Kenneth Kaunda began to introduce various acts that abrogated most of the powers allotted to Barotseland under the agreement.<ref name=""gga.org""/> Notably, the Local Government Act of 1965 abolished the traditional institutions that had governed Barotseland and brought the kingdom under the administration of a uniform local government system. Then in 1969, the Zambian Parliament passed the Constitutional Amendment Act, annulling the Barotseland Agreement of 1964. Later that year the government changed Barotseland's name to Western Province and announced that all provinces would be treated ""equally"".  The agreement's dissolution and the stubbornness of successive governments in ignoring repeated calls to restore it have fuelled the region's ongoing tension.<ref name=""gga.org""/> One of the reasons why Kenneth Kaunda ""revoked"" the United Kingdom's [[Zambia Independence Act 1964|Zambia Independence Act]] is reported to be that it called for the continuation of Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bnfa.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Zambia-Independence-Act-1964.pdf|title=Zambia Independence Act 1964|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

Barotseland independentists continued to lobby to be treated as a separate state and was given substantial [[autonomy]] within the later states, [[Northern Rhodesia]] and independent Zambia. At the pre-Independence talks, the Barotse simply asked for a continuation of ""Queen Victoria's protection"".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/gervasclay/|title=Gervas Clay {{!}} Home|website=www.spanglefish.com|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

=== Post-colonial era ===
A desire to secede was expressed from time to time, causing some friction with the government of [[Kenneth Kaunda]], reflected in Kaunda changing the name from Barotseland Province to Western Province, and subsequently tearing up the 1964 Agreement. According to Barotse activists' views, the government in [[Lusaka]] also starved Barotseland of development – it has only one tarred road into the centre, from [[Lusaka]] to the provincial capital of [[Mongu]], and lacks the kind of state infrastructure projects found in other provinces.  Electricity supplies are erratic, relying on an aging connection<ref>African languages in general do not have a word for ""maintenance""</ref> from the [[Kariba Dam]] [[hydroelectric]] plant. Consequently, secessionist views are still aired from time to time.<ref name=""Spectrum""/><ref>{{cite news|date=29 March 2012|title=Ngambela on BBC: we are forming our own Barotse country|newspaper=Zambian Watchdog|url=http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/ngambela-on-bbc-we-are-forming-our-own-barotse-country/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803010229/http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/ngambela-on-bbc-we-are-forming-our-own-barotse-country/|archive-date=3 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 2012 call for independence ===
In 2012, a Barotseland National Council accepted Zambia's [[Abrogation in public law|abrogation]] of the Barotseland Agreement 1964, alleging to terminate the treaty by which Barotseland initially joined Zambia.<ref name=""BBCseeks"">{{cite news |date=29 March 2012 |title=Barotseland kingdom seeks to leave Zambia |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17546620 |newspaper=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

In 2013, Barotseland became a member of the UNPO, the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].<ref name=""UPNO"" />

Due to continuing human rights violations on the part of Zambia, in 2013 the Barotseland National Freedom Alliance also petitioned the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] in [[Banjul|Banjul, the Gambia]], to examine Zambia's violations. This matter is currently being examined by the commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnfa.info/2014/03/07/zambia-governments-desperation-over-the-people-of-barotselands-banjul-petition/|title=Zambian government's desperation over the people of Barotseland's Banjul petition|work=bnfa.info|date=7 March 2014|access-date=8 November 2015|archive-date=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121205950/http://bnfa.info/2014/03/07/zambia-governments-desperation-over-the-people-of-barotselands-banjul-petition/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The national flag of Barotseland has a red field and a white stripe.<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 16, 2016 |title=Barotseland: National symbols, know your national flag |url=https://barotselandpost.com/top-stories/barotseland-national-symbols-know-your-national-flag |work=Barotseland Post |archive-date=3 August 2019 |access-date=28 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803094929/http://barotselandpost.com/top-stories/barotseland-national-symbols-know-your-national-flag |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The traditional constitutional monarchy of Barotseland has [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] origins{{clarify|date=November 2016}} with the kingdom originally divided into north and south. The north being ruled by a man, the King, called the [[Litunga]] meaning ""keeper"" or ""guardian of the earth"", and the south is ruled by a woman, ''Litunga'' la Mboela or Mulena Mukwae, ""Queen of the south"". Both are allegedly directly descended from the ancient ''Litunga'' Mulambwa who ruled at the turn of the nineteenth century and through his grandson, ''Litunga'' [[Lewanika]] who ruled from 1878 to 1916, with one break in 1884–85. He restored the traditions of the Lozi political economy in the arena of the invasion by the [[Makololo]], internal competition, external threats such as that posed by the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] and the spread of [[European colonialism]].<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{cite book|author=Clay, G.

The government of Barotseland is the Kuta, presided over by the Ngambela (Prime Minister).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Madzudzo |first1=E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUZHAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+government+of+Barotseland+is+the+Kuta%2C+presided+over+by+the+Ngambela+%28Prime+Minister%29&pg=PA6 |title=A Governance analysis of the Barotse Floodplain System, Zambia: Identifying obstacles and opportunities |last2=Mulanda |first2=A. |last3=Nagoli |first3=J. |last4=Lunda |first4=J. |last5=Ratner |first5=B.D. |date= |publisher=[[WorldFish]] |year=2013 |location=Penang, Malaysia |pages=6 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Current situation ===
Activists claim Barotseland is now theoretically independent from Zambia on the basis of the Zambian High Court ruling (see below), that the 1964 Agreement was unilaterally abrogated<ref>{{cite web |last=Kwalombota |first=Saleya |title=Barotseland Post |url=https://www.barotsepost.com/index.php/component/k2/item/422-kenneth-kaunda-s-i-wish-to-inform-the-nation-speech-of-1969-an-act-of-deception-in-his-quest-to-fix-barotseland-saleya-kwalombota#.VNijhmkhA7g.facebook |access-date=8 November 2015 |work=barotsepost.com}}</ref> by Zambia, as being null and void (see above) – i.e., Zambia washed its hands of Barotseland, which therefore reverted to the situation that existed before Zambian Independence; i.e. that Barotseland remains a Protectorate of Great Britain. However, Britain does not want to get involved.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== Political parties ===
In the [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1962|1962 elections]], the Barotse National Party was established to contest the two Barotseland districts, as part of an electoral alliance with the [[United Federal Party]]. In both districts, the BNP candidate heavily lost to the [[United National Independence Party|UNIP]] candidate.<ref>[[Robert Rotberg]], ""Inconclusive Election in Northern Rhodesia."" ''[[Africa Report]]'', Vol. 7, No. 1 (Dec., 1962)</ref>

Currently, there are three groups who claim to represent Barotseland. In January 2012, the president of Zambia, [[Michael Sata]], met the representatives of the three groups at the Zambian State House in [[Lusaka]]. The groups are Linyungandambo, Barotse Freedom Movement (BFM), and the Movement for the Restoration of Barotseland.<ref>{{cite news|title=President Sata officially makes the Barotseland Agreement of 1964 public|date=15 January 2012|newspaper=Lusaka Times|url=http://www.lusakatimes.com/2012/01/15/president-sata-officially-barotseland-agreement-1964-public/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019234353/http://www.lusakatimes.com/2012/01/15/president-sata-officially-barotseland-agreement-1964-public/|archive-date=19 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Experts have said that these three groups may become political parties should Barotseland gain independence. Fighting between the three groups has already surfaced. An article which appeared on the [[Zambian Watchdog]], purported to be authored by a BFM representative, condemned the activities of the Linyungandambo group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/index.php/editors-choice/bfm-fights-linyungandambo-freedom-fighters-puts-hope-in-sata/|title=BFM fights Linyungandambo freedom fighters, puts hope in Sata|work=zambianwatchdog.com|access-date=8 November 2015}}</ref> The BFM accused the Linyungandambo of having set up Barotseland Government portal website without consultations, and included BFM members in the purported Barotseland Government without their consent, and in disregard of the effort being made by Sata to find a lasting solution. The author, Shuwanga Shuwanga, stated that Linyungandambo had refused to work with the BFM back in 2011.

The various activist groups championing the [[self-determination]] of Barotseland have since formed one umbrella organisation called the Barotse National Freedom Alliance (BNFA) which is headed by the former Ngambela of Barotseland (Prime Minister) [[Clement Sinyinda|Clement W. Sinyinda]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|publisher=Barotse National Freedom Alliance (BNFA)|url=http://bnfa.info/48-2/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407173106/http://bnfa.info/48-2/|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Mukuyoyisa, Mukunyandela wa Nyandi|title=Barotse National Freedom Alliance makes a presentation in Cape Town|date=26 November 2013|newspaper=Zambian Eye|url=http://zambianeye.com/archives/16797|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423185135/http://zambianeye.com/archives/16797|archive-date=23 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Congo Pedicle,"{{Short description|Southern protrusion of Congo into Zambia}}
[[Image:LocationZambia.png|framed|Zambia's butterfly shape formed by the Congo Pedicle]]
The '''Congo Pedicle''' (at one time referred to as the '''Zaire Pedicle'''; in [[French language|French]], ''{{lang|fr|la botte du Katanga}}'', meaning 'Katanga boot') is the southeast [[Salient (geography)|salient]] of the [[Haut-Katanga Province]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], which divides neighbouring [[Zambia]] into two lobes. In area, the pedicle is similar in size to [[Wales]] or [[New Jersey]]. '[[wikt:pedicle|Pedicle]]' is used in the sense of 'a little foot'. 'Congo Pedicle' or 'the Pedicle' is also used to refer to the [[Congo Pedicle road]], which crosses it.

The Congo Pedicle is an example of the boundaries imposed by [[Europe|European powers]] on [[Africa]] in the wake of the [[Scramble for Africa]],<ref>Francis M. Deng: ''Africa and the New World Dis-Order: Rethinking Colonial Borders''. Brookings Review, Vol. 11, Spring 1993</ref> which were set by European interests and usually did not consider pre-existing political or tribal boundaries.<ref>Ieuan Griffiths: ""The Scramble for Africa: Inherited Political Boundaries"", ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol 152 No 2, July 1986, pp 204-216.</ref>

As it is located at the country's southeastern extremity, its eastern end is closer to the capital cities of 17 other African countries than its own, [[Kinshasa]].

==British and Belgian territorial claims==
[[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) approached Katanga from the south, and the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Leopold II of the Belgians|King Leopold II]]'s [[Congo Free State]] (CFS) approached from the northwest. Southeast Katanga was controlled by the Yeke or [[Garanganze]] kingdom of [[Msiri]] based at [[Bunkeya]] (see map{{which|date=January 2024}}), and the BSAC and CFS competed to sign treaties with him while he tried to play one off against the other.<ref name=""Gordon"">David Gordon: ''Decentralized Despots or Contingent Chiefs: Comparing Colonial Chiefs in Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo.'' KwaZulu-Natal History and African Studies Seminar, University of Natal, Durban, 2000.</ref>

After Msiri's death the CFS was quicker to consolidate their claim to Msiri's territory called 'Garanganza', and later Katanga, west up to the [[Luapula River|Luapula]]. Since 1885 they already had claimed land north of the [[River Congo|Congo]]-[[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] [[Water divide|watershed]]. The BSAC was left with the land south of the watershed and east of the Luapula. The 1884–85 [[Berlin Conference]] was organised by [[Germany]] to resolve the outcome of the [[Scramble for Africa]]. It did not set the actual boundaries, but agreed areas of influence, including the CFS's control over the Congo. Detailed borders were left to bilateral negotiations.<ref name=""Gordon""/>
[[Image:Congo Pedicle map showing neighbouring Zambia.png|framed|Map showing the Congo Pedicle relative to the borders formed by the Luapula River and Congo-Zambezi watershed.]]

===Negotiating borders===
The main problem of both the Belgian and British sides over the southeast Katanga border was the lack of an obvious geographical feature for the border to follow, as the Congo-Zambezi watershed boundary and the Luapula do not meet. Separated by a distance of {{convert|70|to|150|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}, they run in an arc curving southeast then northeast, running almost parallel but gradually getting closer, and would reach the highlands between Lakes [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Malawi|Nyasa]] if the [[Chambeshi River]], considered the ultimate source stream of the Congo River, were accepted as being the same river as the Luapula.

From the British point of view, the obvious choice for the border would have been southwest to northeast line from the watershed to the Luapula. Failing agreement on that, a second option would be to continue southwards the line of the Luapula-[[Lake Mweru]] valley ([[longitude]] 28° 35' E) which forms the longest north–south part of the border, until it intersects the Congo-Zambezi watershed, so all of the country immediately east of a north–south line through [[Ndola]] would then be in [[Northern Rhodesia]].<ref name=""Google"">http://earth.google.com/ Google Earth accessed 6 February 2007</ref> But the Belgians hoped for access to the rich game areas of the [[Bangweulu Wetlands]] and pressed for the borders to stick to the river and watershed. In negotiations for a treaty some 'trading' of territories was involved in northeast Congo, [[Sudan]] and [[Uganda]].<ref>https://www.angelfire.com/mac/egmatthews/worldinfo/africa/uganda.html Mathews, E.G: ""World Info: Uganda"" accessed 6 February 2007; but see also [[Lado Enclave]].</ref> There was also the question of how far east into the Bangweulu swamps and [[floodplain]] the Pedicle should extend. The king of Italy was called in to adjudicate, and he drew a north–south line (a line of longitude) through a point on the map where the Luapula was thought to exit from the Lake Bangweulu swamps, which gave birth to the Pedicle: {{convert|70|to|100|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} wide and about {{convert|200|km|mi}} long.

===Anglo-Belgian Agreement of 12 May 1894===
The agreement was incorporated into this larger treaty between Great Britain and [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]], which dealt mainly with [[Equatoria]].

===Anglo-Belgian Boundary Commission, 1911–1914===
It became apparent as the region was more closely surveyed that on the ground there were a number of problems. The Luapula does not always flow in a single channel; there are islands, swamps, multiple channels; and the main channel may change according to the river height. It is particularly confusing south of Bangweulu, where there is not one single clear channel exiting the swamps but a tangled mass of channels in swamps and floodplains tens of kilometres wide, and the Italian king's line of longitude crossed them at multiple points.<ref name=""Gordon""/>

An Anglo-Belgian Boundary Commission was established in 1911 to survey the boundaries on the ground, resolve the problems and mark the border with posts and timber towers used for [[triangulation]]. The Italian king's ruler was moved west to a point where it did cut a clearly defined channel in one place. Finally, the work was complete in 1914.

==Consequences for Northern Rhodesia/Zambia==
As a consequence of Katanga attaining the Pedicle, it gained a toehold in the Bangweulu Wetlands and potential mineral resources, although as it turned out, the division of the main copper orebody between the Congo and Northern Rhodesia was determined by the Congo{{endash}}Zambezi watershed and would not have been affected by the existence or otherwise of the Pedicle. It was the BSAC's failure to get Msiri to sign up Garanganza as a [[British protectorate]] which lost the Congolese Copperbelt to Northern Rhodesia, and some in the BSAC complained that the British missionaries [[Frederick Arnot|Frederick Stanley Arnot]] and Charles Swan could have done more to help, although their [[Plymouth Brethren]] mission had a policy of not being involved in politics.<ref>http://www.dacb.org/stories/demrepcongo/crawford_daniel.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002135/http://www.dacb.org/stories/demrepcongo/crawford_daniel.html |date=2007-09-27 }} Dr. J. Keir Howard: ""Crawford, Daniel"" and ""Arnot, Frederick"", in ''Dictionary of African Christian Biography'', website accessed 7 February 2007</ref> Once Msiri was killed by the CFS it was too late to try again, and consequently the leader of CFS expedition responsible, Canadian Captain [[William Grant Stairs]] was viewed by some in Northern Rhodesia as a traitor to the [[British Empire]].<ref>''The [[Northern Rhodesia Journal]]'' ([http://www.nrzam.org.uk online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207032907/http://www.nrzam.org.uk/ |date=2019-12-07 }}), Vol II No 6 (1954) pp67−77. Justice J. B. Thomson: ''Memories of Abandoned Bomas No 8: Chiengi''. Accessed 7 March 2007. The author calls Stairs a 'renegade Englishman' and repeats a rumour that Stairs stole Sharpe's treaty after Msiri had actually signed it, which, while untrue, is indicative of the depth of the feeling in Northern Rhodesia against Stairs.</ref>

===Strategic issues for Zambia===
The problems for Zambia did not emerge for another 50 years, with the [[Congo Crisis]] of 1960{{endash}}63. The Pedicle cuts off the [[Luapula Province]] and the western part of the [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]] from the country's industrial and commercial hub of the [[Copperbelt]]. This is exacerbated by the fact that at the Pedicle's toe tip, where the [[Luapula River]] ostensibly flows out of the Bangweulu system, the river swamps are at least {{convert|6|km|mi}} wide and the floodplain is {{convert|60|km|mi}} wide,<ref name=""Google""/> making a road impossible with the resources available for most of the 20th century. The [[Congo Pedicle road|most southerly road]] possible into Luapula keeping to Zambian territory was pushed, by these circumstances, another {{convert|200|km|mi}} north, going around Lake Bangweulu.

Strategically, the Congo Pedicle is an issue for Zambia, though not for DR Congo. As well as affecting communication for about one-quarter of the country with the centre and west, it potentially exposes a greater part of Zambia, which has generally enjoyed peace for more than 100 years, to conflict in Katanga, which has not. Zambia has witnessed violence in Katanga between armed factions and by the military against civilians which occasionally has spilled over into Zambia, or which has affected Zambians travelling on the Pedicle road.<ref>Mwelwa C. Musambachime: ""Military Violence against Civilians: The Case of the Congolese and Zairean Military in the Pedicle 1890–1988"". ''International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Vol. 23, No. 4 (1990)</ref> At times, it has been closed to them making the huge detour around the north and east of Bangweulu the only option. Secondly, cross-border crime and arms smuggling has been a problem in the Copperbelt, as has poaching in the Bangweulu Wetlands.<ref>http://timesofzambia.com.zm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Times of Zambia'' website accessed 6 February 2007.</ref>

'''Fiwale Hill''' is a distinctive hill located in [[Zambia]], notable as a geographical landmark and the namesake for significant community infrastructure, including Fiwale Hill Hospital, Fiwale Hill School, and Fiwale Hill Church.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/>

==Current infrastructure and facilities==
The area immediately surrounding Fiwale Hill is home to community facilities that serve the local population.

===Fiwale Hill Hospital===
The '''Fiwale Hill Hospital''' see in the photo was built in 1954 by Harold Creasey. The hospital then developed into the Fiwale Hill Leprosy Settlement, which officially opened in 1956. By 1960, it had become the primary facility for the treatment of all leprosy patients in Zambia. A training course for leprosy control officers was also opened at Fiwale Hill in 1963.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/> Today, the hospital provides for services for the residents of and surrounding communities. The hospital provides access to medical attention (e.g. general healthcare, maternal and child health services, outpatient care, emergency services, etc.) in the region.<ref name=""LeprosyHistory""/><ref name=""Barnes1999""/>
[[File:Fiwale Hill Hospital Zambia.jpg|thumb|Fiwale Hill Hospital Zambia]]

===Fiwale Hill School===
Adjacent to the hospital is the '''Fiwale Hill School''', an educational institution that caters to the local youth. The school, which opened in 1958, provided primary education and by 1963 had 200 pupils.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/> Currently, the school provides for students from Fiwale Hill and surrounding villages.

===Fiwale Hill Church===
The '''Fiwale Hill Church''' serves as the spiritual center of the Fiwale Hill Mission. Established as part of the initial mission station in 1954, it has been instrumental in the religious life of the community. Notably, the church incorporates [[Norman architecture]] elements, including its distinctive rounded arches, which are a characteristic feature of this style of construction, as seen in structures like [[St Swithun's Church, Nately Scures]] in England. The use of such arches in building provides structural support and allows for wide, durable openings, contributing to the church's stability and design. The church has historically played a significant role in training and equipping local church leaders and evangelists, working alongside resident missionaries.<ref name=""Barnes1999""/><ref name=""Dube2007""/>
[[File:Fiwali Hill Church Zambia.jpg|thumb|Fiwali Hill Church Zambia]]

==History and development==
The development of Fiwale Hill as a center for community services was advanced in 1954, when the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] (BMS) agreed to support the mission station there. This initiative was intended as a rural centre for leprosy work, general medical services, and education.<ref name=""Dube2007""/> The subsequent infrastructure development of the mission was led by Harold Creasey, a London businessman with considerable engineering skills. During the 13 years Creasey lived at Fiwale Hill, he continued to campaign in Britain for the development of Fiwale Hill in what was then [[Northern Rhodesia]].<ref name=""Barnes1999""/>

==Notable people from Fiwale Hill==
Fiwale Hill and its surrounding area have been associated with individuals who have achieved broader recognition.

One such figure is '''[[Howard Mwikuta]]''' (1941–2022), a prominent Zambian international footballer and coach. Mwikuta, born near Fiwale Hill in 1941, went on to have a distinguished career playing for the [[Zambia national football team|Zambia national team]] and notable clubs such as [[Mufulira Wanderers F.C.]] in Zambia and the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in the United States.

'''Mutuke''' is a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] and [[river]] in the [[Mungwi District]] of [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]], [[Zambia]].<ref>Geographic Names [https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-3172870&fid=6759&c=zambia  Full Name: Mutuke] Retrieved 20 April 2022.</ref><ref>Geographical Names [https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-3172870&fid=6759&c=zambia|Mutuke, Zambia] Retrieved 22 April 2022</ref>

==Background and history==
Mutuke Hamlet is situated west of the Mutuke, a stone throw from the river bank. It has one large homestead and an arable plot to its west. As ancient immigrants left trails of sojourning evidence, it is thought this place in [[Zambia]] was named after one of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] immigrant clans many centuries ago as they drifted further south in search for better [[agricultural land]].

Currently, this place is remotely inhabited by one large homestead dwellers. The rest of the land is flora and small fauna.<ref>OSM [https://osmand.net/go?lat=-9.799996648141502&lon=31.5507043360752&z=20|Humanitarian Map] Retrieved 22 April 2022</ref>

==Operations== 
The only significance of Mutuke as a geographical place name is the possible link it has with [[Mutuke|Mutuke Village]] of [[Nigeria]]. 
Today Mutuke is not a common name in the [[Sub-Equatorial Africa]] but the Mutuke Clan in Zimbabwe could only assume Mutuke of Zambia is primary evidence supporting their oral history as having their origins in and around what is [[Nigeria]] today.
The surname is most prevalent in [[Zimbabwe]]<ref>Forebears [https://forebears.io/surnames/mutuke|Mutuke Surname] Retrieved 22 April 2022</ref>

==Mutuke River==
Mutuke is a body of running water and a tributary of the [[Chambeshi River]].

Muva,"The '''Muva''' is a term coined by [[E.H. Ackermann]] (1950)<ref>Ackermann, E.H., 1950, Ein neuer Faltengurtel in. Nordrhodesien und seine tectonische Stellung im Afrikanishen grundgebirge. Geologische Rundschau, 38: 24-39</ref> for a folded [[supracrustal]] shallow water succession of [[quartzite]]s and [[pelite]]s in the [[Irumide Belt]] of [[Zambia]]. The ""Muva"" was first described by [[A. Gray (geologist)|A. Gray]] (1930).<ref>Gray A. (1930) The correlation of the ore-bearing sediments of the Katanga and. Rhodesian Copperbelt. ''[[Economic Geology (journal)|Economic Geology]]'', 25, 783-801.</ref>

The sequence is interpreted as a 1.8 billion year old shallow marine to coastal sequence which includes dunal deposits (aeolian), beach sands, offshore sand deposits and deeper water pelitic sediments. The alternation of quartzite-pelite successions was interpreted to record transgressive and regressive phases of a coastline along the southern margin of the [[Bangweulu Block]].  The presence of these types of rocks is also seen in areas that have undergone marine transgression.  

In the western coastline of the Indian peninsula the [[Jurassic]] strata show this character of undergoing a submergence owing to crustal disturbance on the surface of the ocean floor and lead to the presence of marl with limestone in shallow water areas. Such effects are widely observed along the western coastline of India in parts of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] ([[Gujarat]]) and the Salt Range of [[Rajasthan]].

Despite several steps taken by the previous government in order to fight '''corruption in [[Zambia]]''', there has not been a dramatic improvement in the public perception of anti-corruption efforts over the past years.

In 2024, Zambia scored 39 on a scale from 0 (""highly corrupt"") to 100 (""very clean"").

Unnecessarily long and complicated administrative procedures are common in [[Zambia|Zambia's]] business environment, leading many companies to operate in the [[Informal economy|informal sector]]. The risk of widespread use of [[Facilitating payment|facilitation payments]] is also high due to the bureaucratic procedures for obtaining licences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zambia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|date=April 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000528/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

Political corruption is seen as the most prevalent, specifically bribery.

The '''First Hichilema Cabinet''' is the executive government of the [[Republic of Zambia]] under the leadership of [[First presidency of Hakainde Hichilema|President Hakainde Hichilema]]. It was formed following Hichilema’s victory in the [[2021 Zambian general election]], in which his party, the [[United Party for National Development|UPND]], defeated the incumbent [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|PF]] led by President [[Edgar Lungu]]. Hichilema was sworn in on 24 August 2021,<ref>{{Cite news |last=MULIKELELA |first=MAIMBOLWA |date=August 24, 2022 |title=Timeline of President Hakainde Hichilema's first year in office |url=https://www.times.co.zm/?p=119219 |access-date=2025-07-02 |work=times.co.zm}}</ref> and the formation of his cabinet marked a significant transition in Zambia’s political landscape, emphasizing anti-corruption, economic recovery, and institutional reform.

The cabinet included a mix of experienced politicians and [[Technocracy|technocrats]], with a notable commitment to gender inclusion and youth representation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Cabinet – cabinet office |url=https://www.cabinet.gov.zm/?page_id=2193 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20250518033857/https://www.cabinet.gov.zm/?page_id=2193 |archive-date=2025-05-18 |access-date=2025-07-02 |website=www.cabinet.gov.zm |language=en-US}}</ref> The [[Vice President of Zambia|Vice-President]], [[Mutale Nalumango]], became the second woman in Zambia’s history to hold the position.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-15 |title=Zambia: Vice President Mutale Nalumango's modest upbringing should help break stereotypes and the entrenched cycle of female exclusion |url=https://nawmagazine.com/17797/ |access-date=2025-07-02 |website=The New African Woman |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Judiciary of Zambia,"{{Politics of Zambia}}
The '''Judiciary of Zambia''' is the branch of the Government of the [[Republic of Zambia]] which interprets and applies the country's laws to ensure impartial justice under law and to provide a mechanism for dispute resolution. Under the [[Constitution of Zambia|1991 Constitution]], justices and magistrates are independent of the government and subject only to the Constitution and the law.

According to the constitutional amendments of Act No. 2 of 2016, the structure of the judicature shall comprise the Supreme Court, with an equal ranking to the Constitutional Court, the appeals court, the High Court, the Subordinate Court, the Local Court and such lower courts as may be prescribed by an Act of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/about-judiciary/introduction|title= Introduction|publisher= Judiciary of Zambia|accessdate= 22 February 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://archive.today/20140312224744/http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/about-judiciary/introduction|archivedate= 12 March 2014}}</ref><ref>https://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/amendment_act/Constitution%20of%20Zambia%20%20(Amendment),%202016-Act%20No.%202_0.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>

The functions of the Judiciary include the administration of justice through resolving disputes between individuals or between individuals and the state, interpreting the Constitution and the laws of Zambia, promoting the rule of law, and protecting the human rights of individuals and groups.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arms of Government |url=https://www.elections.org.zm/verc/governmentArms.php |access-date=2022-05-23 |website=Electoral Commission of Zambia |language=en}}</ref>

==Supreme Court==
[[File:Zambia Supreme Court.JPG|thumb|240px|Supreme Court, Lusaka]]

The Supreme Court of Zambia is the final court of appeal and has the final say in all legal matters, including the interpretation of the Constitution. It consists of the chief justice, the deputy chief justice and seven or more Supreme Court judges. It is located in Independence Avenue, Lusaka.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/supreme-court|title= Supreme Court|publisher= Judiciary of Zambia|accessdate= 22 February 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160628080301/http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/supreme-court|archivedate= 28 June 2016}}</ref>

=== The Constitutional Court of Zambia ===
Zambia in 2016 amended the Republican Constitution which created the new court called the Constitutional Court of Zambia. Locally nicknamed as the Concourt, it is established by Articles 127, 128 and 129. This court is constitutionally clothed with the power of interpreting presidential elections, constitutional supremacy, the Constitution, and members of parliament appeal cases which are at first heard by the High Court. The court ranks equivalently or at par to the Supreme Court of Zambia. The judicial decision of the Constitutional Court of Zambia is final and non-appealable to the Supreme Court. Subject to Article 28, this court does not hear Bill of Rights cases, because the 2016 referendum failed to gainer sufficient votes to amend the Bill of Rights. For now the Bill of Rights cases are heard by the High Court of Zambia.

=== The Court of Appeal of Zambia ===
This court is the third-highest court of appeal in Zambia below the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court. It is above the High Court of Zambia. It has jurisdiction over all appeal matters emanating from the High Court. A case cannot go direct to the Supreme Court, and the parties must obtain leave of the Court of Appeal according the Rules of the Court of Appeal 2016. The Court has no jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution; when a matter arises, the Court of Appeal will halt the proceedings and refer the matter to the Constitutional Court of Zambia for interpretation.

==High Court==
The High Court's role is judicial review, in other words, interpretation of the law. It has the power to declare any law or ordinance unconstitutional if it is found to be against the Zambian Constitution. A High Court alone can certify the cases fit for appeal before the Supreme Court.<ref>Mulenga Besa (2019), Constitution, Governance and Democracy, Mission Press, Ndola, edited by Kwivwa Mudolo</ref>

This court can be categorized into three separate courts, namely family courts, business court and industrial relations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/high-courts|title= High Courts|publisher= Judiciary of Zambia|accessdate= 22 February 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160628075102/http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/high-courts|archivedate= 28 June 2016}}</ref>

==Industrial relations courts==
Located within Supreme Court premises. It is responsible for labour-related cases. It is a division of the High Court that adjudicates over labour matters. The High Court rules apply to it.

It was initially located where the Curt of Appeal is located today.

==Subordinate courts==
These are the lower courts and the courts of the first instance, and are graded as first, second or third class. They can decide all matters except for offences of treason, murder and all matters that involve interpretations of the Constitution and are presided over by Resident Magistrates of appropriate status.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/subordinate-courts|title= Subordinate Courts|publisher= Judiciary of Zambia|accessdate= 22 February 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151029124321/http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/subordinate-courts|archivedate= 29 October 2015}}</ref>

==Small claims courts==
The Small Claims Courts deal with minor financial claims (less than K 20,000) except in certain circumstances.the cases are civil in nature and are handled by commissioners.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/small-claims-courts|title= Small Claims Court|publisher= Judiciary of Zambia|accessdate= 22 February 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160419011110/http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/small-claims-courts|archivedate= 19 April 2016}}</ref>

==Local courts==
The Local Courts deal with customary matters, it also not a court of record because there's no strict adherence to what the law says the cases are civil in nature. They are also limited in terms of the severity of the sentences they can impose.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/local-courts|title= Local Courts|publisher= Judiciary of Zambia|accessdate= 22 February 2016|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160628080655/http://www.judiciary.gov.zm/index.php/court-structure/local-courts|archivedate= 28 June 2016}}</ref>
===Law===

Before the end of BSAC administration, Northern Rhodesian law was in conformity with the laws of [[England and Wales]] and its High Court of Northern Rhodesia was ultimately subordinate to those of the United Kingdom. This continued after 1924; all United Kingdom statutes in force on 17 August 1911 were applied to Northern Rhodesia, together with those of later years if specific to the Protectorate. Where Africans were parties before courts, Native law and customs were applied, except if they were ""repugnant to natural justice or morality"", or inconsistent with any other law in force.<ref>G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, pp. 279–80.</ref>

====Subsidiary Courts====

Below the High Court were Magistrates' Courts which fell into four classes:
#Courts of Provincial Commissioners, Senior Resident Magistrates and Resident Magistrates. In criminal matters, such courts could impose sentences of imprisonment for up to three years; in civil matters, they were limited to awards of £200 and for recovery of land worth up to £144 annual rent.
#Courts of District Commissioners. In criminal matters, they could impose sentences of imprisonment for up to one year without confirmation by the High Court; they could also impose up to three years' imprisonment with the High Court's consent. Their civil jurisdiction was limited to £100.
#Courts of District Officers.
#Courts of Cadets attached to the Provincial Administration.

Criminal trials for treason, murder and manslaughter, or attempts and conspiracies to commit them, were reserved for the High Court. Civil matters relating to constitutional issues, wills and marriages were also restricted to the High Court.

====Native Courts====

The Native Courts Ordinance 1937 allowed the Governor to issue a warrant recognising native courts. Their jurisdiction only covered natives but extended to criminal and civil jurisdiction. Native courts were not allowed to impose the death penalty, nor try [[witchcraft]] without permission. There was also provision for a Native Court of Appeal, but if not established, appeal was to the Provincial Commissioner and thence to the High Court.

{{Politics of Zambia}}
The '''National Assembly''' is [[Zambia]]'s [[unicameral]] legislative body. Between 1972 and 1990, Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) as the sole legal party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mushingeh|first=Chiponde|title=Unrepresentative 'democracy': One-Party Rule in Zambia, 1973-1990|date=1994|journal=Transafrican Journal of History|volume=23|pages=117–141|jstor=24520273|issn=0251-0391}}</ref>

The current National Assembly, formed following elections held in 2021, has a total of 166 members. 156 members are directly elected in single-member [[Constituency|constituencies]] using the simple plurality (or [[first-past-the-post]]) system. Eight additional seats are filled through [[President of Zambia|presidential]] appointment. The Speaker, first deputy speaker and the [[Vice President of Zambia|Vice President]] are also granted a seat in the assembly.

==Electoral system==
Of the 167 members of the National Assembly, 156 are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member constituencies, with a further eight appointed by the President and three others being ''ex-officio'' members: the Vice President, the Speaker and one deputy speakers (one elected from outside the National Assembly, while another is chosen among the elected members of the house).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elections: Zambia President 2015|url=https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2814/|access-date=2021-02-14|website=IFES Election Guide}}</ref> The minimum voting age is 18, whilst National Assembly candidates must be at least 21.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ZAMBIA (National Assembly), Electoral system|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2359_B.htm|access-date=2021-02-14|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref>

== Location ==
At the time of Zambia's independence in 1964, the National Assembly was housed in inadequate and unsuitable premises behind the Government's Central Offices in Lusaka, commonly known as the ""Secretariat Area"". It was, therefore, apparent at the time of independence that a more fitting building should be constructed to meet future expansion and also to provide adequate members’ sitting and office accommodations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Assembly|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/111|date=2020-05-27|website=National Assembly|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

A site was chosen on the crown of a low hill in Lusaka, which dominated the surrounding landscape of the city. The site was also, at one time, the site of the dwelling place of the village headman, Lusaka, after whom the city is now named.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Assembly|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/111|date=2020-05-27|website=National Assembly|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

The new National Assembly building was planned so that its external appearance expressed the dignity and power of the Government, while internally, it is planned to function as a centre of administration. The focal point of the building is the Chamber, which is rich in decoration and colour, in contrast to the rest of the building.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Assembly of Zambia|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/111|date=2020-05-27|website=National Assembly of Zambia|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

'''State House''' is the official residence and principal workplace of the [[President of Zambia]]. Located in the Bimbe area of [[Lusaka]] on Independence Avenue, the estate occupies approximately 72 hectares (178 acres). <ref>{{Cite web |title=About State House |url=https://www.sh.gov.zm/about/}}</ref>Designed by [[British Empire|British]] architect [[William Walcot]] in the neoclassical style, construction began in 1930, concluded in 1934, and the building officially opened in 1935. Originally known as Government House, it served as the residence of the colonial governors of [[Northern Rhodesia]] until 1964, after which it was renamed State House and became the official residence of President [[Kenneth Kaunda]], Zambia’s first post-independence head of state.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |last=zamobserver |date=2024-01-15 |title=SEVEN FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT STATE HOUSE, LUSAKA, ZAMBIA - The Zambian Observer |url=https://zambianobserver.com/seven-facts-you-should-know-about-state-house-lusaka-zambia/ |access-date=2025-07-04 |language=en-US}}</ref>

“State House” also functions as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of Zambia, housing the [[Office of the President (Zambia)|Office of the President]], the Vice-President’s Office, the Cabinet Secretariat, the Presidential Delivery Unit, and key ministries—all located within the estate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-01-22 |title=Centre of Government Reform: Zambia State House and Cabinet Office - Kivu International |url=https://www.kivu-international.org/our-work/centre-of-government-reform-zambia-state-house-and-cabinet-office/ |access-date=2025-07-04 |website=Kivu International - Supporting locally-led policy change}}</ref> As the centre of Zambia’s executive branch, State House hosts foreign dignitaries, cabinet meetings, and state ceremonies. The grounds also include displays illustrating the development of Lusaka and Zambia’s political history. The estate includes a golf course, tennis court, a variety of wildlife species, a healthcare clinic, a filling station, and a police post among other amenities.

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===
The Beit Trust was established by [[Alfred Beit|Alfred Beit's]] will in 1906 to support infrastructure development in Northern Rhodesia, funding projects such as roads, bridges, hospitals, and government buildings. Construction of Government House (now State House) began in 1930. Designed by British architect Sir William Walcot in the neoclassical style, the building was completed in 1934 and officially opened in 1935. <ref>{{Cite web |last=zamobserver |date=2020-05-25 |title=Seven Facts You Should Know About State House, Lusaka, Zambia - The Zambian Observer |url=https://zambianobserver.com/seven-facts-you-should-know-about-state-house-lusaka-zambia-2/ |access-date=2025-07-04 |language=en-US}}</ref>From 1935 until independence in 1964, the building served as the residence of 13 colonial governors, including Major Sir Hubert Young and Sir Evelyn Hone. Notably, Sir John Maybin died in office in 1941 and is buried in Lusaka. Besides Government House, the Beit Trust also contributed to infrastructure such as Independence Avenue Road, [[Cairo Road]], [[Lusaka City Airport]], the [[Supreme Court of Zambia]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Cabinet Office in Lusaka, [[University Teaching Hospital]] (European Hospital), [[Kafue Bridge]], [[Luangwa Bridge]], and [[Otto Beit Bridge|Beit Bridge]] on the Zimbabwe–Zambia border.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |title=State House - Chalo Chatu, Zambia online encyclopedia |url=https://chalochatu.org/State_House |access-date=2025-07-04 |website=chalochatu.org}}</ref>

=== Post-independence, security developments and Security controversies ===
Zambia gained independence in 1964, and Government House was renamed State House. Kenneth Kaunda became the first president to reside there. During his tenure, he commissioned additions including Nkwazi House and a 19-hole golf course, and upgraded security in 1974. In 1995, former President Frederick Chiluba publicly revealed secret underground tunnels beneath State House, constructed during Kaunda's administration. The tunnels reportedly served security purposes and contained facilities such as a radio station, bunk beds, damp rooms, and a council chamber. No evidence of torture chambers was found during the inspection. The disclosure caused political controversy. Some officials and the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions demanded punishment for those who revealed the tunnels. Allegations surfaced that Major Ronald Chansa was detained and tortured there in 1981; these claims were denied by Kaunda as isolated or exaggerated incidents. This episode reflected the tense political environment during Zambia’s early multiparty democracy.<ref name="":1"" />

== Current use and condition ==  
Hakainde Hichilema, sworn in on 24 August 2021, continues to operate from State House. On 25 November 2024, he addressed the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Conference held at the residence. The building has shown signs of aging—visible cracks and outdated infrastructure—leading to a 2017 parliamentary recommendation for a US$20 million rebuild. However, this has not yet been implemented, and the original structure remains in use.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-07-02 |title=Zambia : Construction of New State House to begin next year |url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2017/07/02/construction-new-state-house-begin-next-year/ |access-date=2025-07-04 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Occupants ===  
Since 1935, 13 colonial governors have lived in State House, with Major Sir Hubert Young being the first occupant and [[Evelyn Hone|Sir Evelyn Hone]] the last governor to live there. During this time, one governor, Sir John Maybin, died in office on 9 April 1941 and is the only governor buried at Aylmer May Cemetery in Rhodes Park, Lusaka.<ref name="":0"" /> Since independence, six presidents have resided in State House, including [[Levy Mwanawasa]] and [[Michael Sata]], both of whom died in office while living there. However, the current president, Hakainde Hichilema, resides in his private residence known as the Community House in New Kasama rather than within State House.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mwila wonders what HH fears about living in State House |url=https://diggers.news/local/2024/03/03/mwila-wonders-what-hh-fears-about-living-in-state-house/ |access-date=2025-07-04 |website=Zambia: News Diggers! |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=HH can live in a shanty compound if he wants, Hamasaka tells Mwila |url=https://diggers.news/local/2024/03/04/hh-can-live-in-a-shanty-compound-if-he-wants-hamasaka-tells-mwila/ |access-date=2025-07-04 |website=Zambia: News Diggers! |language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[Zambia]] is a landlocked country in Sub Saharan Africa which experiences a burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. In line with WHO agenda for equity in health, it has adopted the [[Universal Health Coverage]] agenda to mitigate the challenges faced within the health sector. The [[Ministry of Health (Zambia)|Ministry of Health (MOH)]] provides information pertaining to Zambian health.  The main focus of the Ministry of Health has been provision of uninterrupted care with emphasis on health systems strengthening and services via the primary health care approach.

The WHO Health systems framework utilizes key parameters are to assess health sector performance. These include health service delivery, human resource for health, infrastructure development, drugs and medical supplies, health care financing and health information.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-08-22|title=A new era for the WHO health system building blocks?|url=https://healthsystemsglobal.org/news/a-new-era-for-the-who-health-system-building-blocks/|access-date=2021-09-15|website=Health Systems Global|language=en}}</ref>

===HIV/AIDS epidemic===
{{Further|HIV/AIDS in Zambia}}

Zambia has made great strides in allieviating the impact of the HIV epidemic.  According to UNAIDS, annual HIV infections (for all ages) in Zambia have declined from 60,000 in 2010 to 51,000 in 2019. New infections among children 0–14 years declined from an estimated 10,000 in 2010 to 6,000 in 2019. There has been a decline in annual AIDS-related deaths from 24,000 in 2010 to 19,000 in 2019 a decrease of about 30 per cent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HIV/AIDS|url=https://www.unicef.org/zambia/hivaids|access-date=2021-09-15|website=www.unicef.org|language=en}}</ref> Despite the progress made, there is a disproportionate burden between males and females with women being affected more than their male counterparts. It is estimated that there are about 26 000 new infections of females above the age of 25 as compared to 19 000 for their male counterparts.{{Further|Millennium Development Goals }}
The Millennium Development Goal target for HIV was ''to keep HIV prevalence below 15%'' and it has been met.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.za.undp.org/content/dam/south_africa/docs/mdgs/MDG%20Report%202013.pdf |title= Millennium Development Goals|accessdate=3 Sep 2015}}</ref>

===Maternal and child healthcare===
The 2010 maternal mortality rate was 470 per 100,000 births in Zambia. This is compared with 602.9 in 2008 and 594.2 in 1990. The under-5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 145 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under-5's mortality is 25. In Zambia, the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 5 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 38.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/resources/docs/country_info/profile/en_Zambia_SoWMy_Profile.pdf|title=The State of the World's Midwifery 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>

Zambia may not attain its goals for reducing the Maternal Mortality ratio to 162/100,000 live births.

=== Adolescent Health ===
According to Zambia Demographic Health Survey 2013–14, about 29% of adolescent girls become pregnant by the age of 19 year. Teenage pregnancies reported among girls in grades 1–12 increased five times (from 3,663 in 2002 to 15,125 in 2015) according to the Ministry of General Education<ref>{{Cite book|title=MOGE Statistical Bulletin, 2015}}</ref>  ZDHS statistics show that the adolescent fertility rate has slowly been declining, from 146 births in 2007 to 141 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in 2014, with teenage pregnancies in rural areas standing at 36% and urban areas at 20% of all pregnancies.<ref>{{Cite journal|date= 2013–2014|title=Zambia Demographic Health Survey|journal=}}</ref> About 32% of adolescents aged 15–17 and 60% of those aged 18–19 are sexually active in Zambia, and therefore face risks to HIV and other STIs, especially as only 40% of them report regular condom use. A related fact is that 42% of women aged 20–24 in Zambia report having been married by age 18.

Contraceptive prevalence rate for modern family planning methods among adolescent girls aged 15–19 was 10.2%, despite the rate having been estimated to have increased from 33% to 45% in the general population (ZDHS 2013–14). Adolescents also experience other health problems that include mental health, trauma, physical and sexual violence, non-communicable diseases, and alcohol and substance abuse.

Key challenges are the following in this category of health:
* Inadequate implementation of ADH strategies at lower levels 
* Inadequate knowledge among adolescents of the existing health services
* Inadequate knowledge among health care workers of key adolescent health issues 
* Inadequate HIV/SRH outreach services for adolescents 
* Lack of ADH-specific indicators

Some of the strategies by the ministry of health to combat these challenges include the strengthening of policy and regulatory frameworks for provision and access of adolescent health services, including clear policies and guidelines on age of consent to key SRH and HIV services and a roll out an adaptive leadership targeting key stakeholders. Further MoH Zambia have embarked on a campaign to strengthen organization and multi-sectoral coordination for an efficient and effective harmonized response to delivering adolescent-responsive health services

In an attempt to provide a minimum adolescent health service platform in all districts of Zambia by 2021, Ministry of Health has scaled up pre-service and in-service adolescent health training of health workers as well as peer educators and their deployed them in adolescent-friendly spaces found at health facilities and communities.

==== Non-Communicable Diseases ====
Communicable diseases have received more attention as compared to non-communicable disease over the last decade. However, with the epidemiological change in the burden of disease, the Ministry of Health has begun to pay more attention to NCDs such as hypertension, diabetes and cancers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=ZAMBIA NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 – 2021}}</ref> 

The diagram below clears shows how over the years NCDs have become important, cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms moved from 7th and 8th rank in 1990 to 3rd and 5th rank in 2021 respectively. The country epidemiology is transitioning and will over the next decade be confronted by more NCDs compared to communicable disease .
The MOH has made tremendous progress in ensuring the availability of medicines and medical supplies for the management and control of NCDs by including NCD medicines and supplies on the essential medicine list for Zambia. However, the essential medicine list does not exhaustively provide for all NCDs and conditions. In order to provide guidance to the fight against NCDs, the Government developed the NCD Strategic Plan 2011–2016, the National Cancer Control Strategic Plan 2022–2026, oral health standards of practice, and NCDs standard treatment guidelines. Notable achievements include establishment and expansion of the Cancer Diseases Hospital; establishment of a national cervical cancer screening programme; finalisation of the mental health and tobacco products control bill; initiation of the HPV vaccination programme for prevention of cervical cancer and accompanying scale-up plan; the commissioning of the cardiac catheterisation laboratory; and implementation of the Rheumatic Heart Disease study. Furthermore, national NCD risk factor surveys will be conducted in 2017 to establish baseline data.<ref>{{Cite book|title=ZAMBIA NATIONAL HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 – 2021}}</ref>

Despite these achievements, key challenges remain and include:
* Lack of Policy and clear legal frameworks to support reductions in NCDs
* Uncoordinated multidisciplinary approach in control of NCD 
* Inadequate human, financial, and material resources for NCD prevention and control 
* Low level of public awareness of NCDs 
* Lack of a communication strategy on NCDs
* Inadequate NCD diagnostic capacity at various levels of health care
* Erratic supply of NCD medicines and medical supplies

To mitigate these challenges various measures have been put in place such as strengthening and promoting active screening for NCDs at all levels, including within health facilities, schools, and communities, so as to generate demand for such services and strengthening subsequent case management. In addition, MoH is continuously developing and distributing information education and communication (IEC) materials for the various non communicable disease. Furthermore, a deliberate attempt to enhance leadership and governance for the social determinants and risk factors of NCDs has been done through the establishment of a national NCD coordinating committee with membership by all ministries.

A major [[environmental disaster]] began on 18 February 2025, when a [[tailings dam]] [[Tailings dam failure|collapsed]] at a Chinese corporation-owned [[Copper extraction|copper mine]] in northern [[Zambia]], releasing approximately {{convert|50|e6l|e6gal|abbr=off}} of acidic and highly toxic [[waste]] into the [[Kafue River]] ecosystem. The contamination severely impacted [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]], water supplies, and [[Agriculture in Zambia|agricultural activities]] along the river, which serves as a critical water source for approximately 60% of Zambia's population.

== Background ==
The [[Kafue River]] is described by the Engineering Institution of Zambia as Zambia's most important waterway, flowing for over {{Convert|1,500|km|mi}} through the country. It forms part of the crucial Kafue River basin where approximately 12 million of Zambia's 20 million citizens reside, or roughly 60% of the population. The river provides drinking water to approximately five million people, including residents of [[Lusaka]], the nation's capital. The river also supports fishing activities and [[Irrigation|agricultural irrigation]] for farmers, while supplying water for industrial operations.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite news |last1=Kille |first1=Richard |last2=Zimba |first2=Jacob |date=15 March 2025 |title=A river 'died' overnight in Zambia after an acidic waste spill at a Chinese-owned mine |url=https://apnews.com/article/mining-pollution-china-zambia-environment-93ee91d1156471aaf9a7ebd6f51333c1 |access-date=15 March 2025 |work=AP News |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250317035516/https://apnews.com/article/mining-pollution-china-zambia-environment-93ee91d1156471aaf9a7ebd6f51333c1 |archive-date=17 March 2025 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Copperbelt Province]] in northern Zambia hosts numerous mining operations, with Chinese companies maintaining a dominant presence in the [[copper extraction]] industry. Zambia was ranked within the top ten copper producers worldwide. Critics have accused Chinese corporation-owned copper mines of disregarding safety, labour, and [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]] in their pursuit to control Zambia's copper supply. Zambia held significant economic ties to China, including [[debt]]s of over US$4 billion to China that required restructuring after Zambia [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] on [[Repayment plan|repayments]] in 2020.<ref name="":0"" />

The contaminated discharge flowed into a tributary stream then into the Kafue.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> Within hours of the spill, environmental impacts became evident as [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] began dying throughout the affected waterway.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> Witnesses living along the river reported that the previously ""vibrant and alive"" river appeared to have ""died overnight,"" with [[Fish kill|fish mortality]] and the disappearance of birdlife occurring almost immediately following the dam failure.<ref name="":0"" />

Abortion in Zambia,"{{Short description|none}}
{{good article}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2024}}
{{EngvarB|date=July 2024}} <!--Use Zambian English-->

In [[Zambia]], [[abortion]] is [[Abortion law|legal]] if the pregnancy would threaten the mother's [[Maternal death|life]] or [[Complications of pregnancy|physical or mental health]] or those of existing children, or if it would cause a [[birth defect]]. Zambia has one of the most permissive [[Abortion in Africa|abortion laws in Africa]], though its restrictions limit access. The Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Act, passed in 1972, legalizes abortion if approved by medical professionals. It requires signatures from three doctors, including one specialist. Amendments to the bill and medical guidelines clarify that the law allows the consideration of situations such as [[pregnancy from rape]], as well as [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic factors]].

Legal abortions are available but often expensive or difficult to access. Some critics of Zambia's abortion law believe that the TOP Act's restrictions are barriers to access for most Zambians. Other critics believe that the country provides for abortions in law but not in practice. The majority of women in Zambia do not know about the abortion law, and many healthcare providers do not know its terms. [[Conscientious objection to abortion]] by medical providers is common. Public providers provide abortions for free, but unofficial costs are often high. Most abortions are performed unsafely by illegal practitioners. Abortion complications commonly occur. Unsafe abortions cause 30% of [[maternal death]]s. Public health providers legally do not charge money for abortions, but unofficial fees are common. Many women cannot afford safe surgical abortions. Medical abortions are widespread in cities. Rural areas have low access to abortion. Adolescents are likely to have unsafe abortions.

Abortion is stigmatised in Zambia. A majority of Zambians believe abortion should be illegal. Zambia's [[state religion]] is Christianity, and churches are influential in [[Christianity and abortion|opposing abortion on religious grounds]]. [[Abortion-rights movements|Supporters of abortion]] believe legal abortion is a solution to public health issues.

== Legislation ==
The Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Act law legalizes abortion if the pregnancy increases the risk of death or physical or mental health issues for the mother or any existing children, or if it would result in a [[birth defect]]. The mother's age and environment in the present or near future may be considered. An abortion must be approved by three medical professionals, including one specialist. This requirement may be waived if one doctor believes it is an emergency.<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> It must be performed in a registered location by a registered practitioner, with the woman's informed consent. Performing or receiving an illegal abortion is punishable by seven years of prison.<ref name=""Katongo"" /> The law allows medical professionals to [[Conscientious objection to abortion|object to performing an abortion]], except in emergencies. The sentence is seven years for illegally providing an abortion and fourteen years for illegally obtaining or assisting in an abortion.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

In May 2009, the [[Ministry of Health (Zambia)|Ministry of Health]] (MOH) wrote a set of guidelines on how to determine whether a pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's health, based on objective and subjective socioeconomic factors. The guidelines allow health providers to perform an abortion based on these factors with the woman's consent and permit mid-level providers to provide abortions in the [[Pregnancy#Trimesters|first trimester]].<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> The guidelines say that clients must be referred to providers willing to assist with abortion, that most government healthcare facilities must ensure access to abortion, and that conscientious objection only applies to individual doctors providing abortion itself.<ref name=""Freeman & Coast"" /> The TOP Act does not specify a gestational limit, but the MOH has regulated that abortion is banned after [[fetal viability]], at 28 weeks.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

Zambia  has one of the region's most liberal abortion laws.<ref name=""Katongo"" /> It is [[Abortion in Africa|one of the only countries in Africa]] to allow abortions for socioeconomic reasons.<ref name=""CFR"">{{Cite news |author=<!--Women and Foreign Policy Program Staff--> |date=7 March 2024 |title=Abortion Law: Global Comparisons |url=https://www.cfr.org/article/abortion-law-global-comparisons |access-date=12 July 2024 |work=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]}}</ref> Its law complies with Article 14(2)(c) of the [[Maputo Protocol]], which it has ratified.<ref name=""Kangaude et al"" /> However, its legislation has been called a ""paper law"".<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"">{{Cite journal |last1=Fetters |first1=Tamara |last2=Samandari |first2=Ghazaleh |last3=Djemo |first3=Patrick |last4=Vwallika |first4=Bellington |last5=Mupeta |first5=Stephen |date=16 February 2017 |title=Moving from legality to reality: how medical abortion methods were introduced with implementation science in Zambia |journal=[[Reproductive Health (journal)|Reproductive Health]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=26 |doi=10.1186/s12978-017-0289-2 |pmc=5314585 |pmid=28209173 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The law is open to interpretation and its restrictions make abortion difficult.

== History ==
Before 1972, the [[penal code of Zambia]] criminalized abortion. In 1972, the TOP Act was proposed to the [[National Assembly of Zambia]]. It was drafted based on the United Kingdom's [[Abortion Act 1967]]. It was passed eight years into the presidency of [[Kenneth Kaunda]], whose [[Zambian Humanism]] ideology involved [[Christian right|conservative Christian]], patriarchal views on female sexuality. The Minister of Health presented it to the parliament, saying, ""the purpose of this Bill is to amend and clarify the law relating to termination of pregnancy by registered medical practitioners"". He argued that clarifying the law would remove doubts among medical practitioners and prevent deaths. His closing remarks said the law did ""not open the flood-gates for termination of pregnancy upon demand"". Opposing MPs argued that it would increase the number of abortions. The bill passed by 66 to 13 votes. The [[Catholic Church in Zambia]] wrote to the Secretary General to the Cabinet to protest the bill, claiming that it had been passed too quickly, without public debate, and was based on a British law. The Speaker of the Parliament wrote to Kaunda to clarify that the bill would not legalize abortion on demand, writing, ""the Bill itself is meant to serve two to five people in twenty years or so"". Kaunda signed the bill into law.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

The passing of the TOP Act was not followed by technical guidance for implementation.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" /> The act was amended in 1994.<ref name=""Katongo"" /> A 2005 amendment specified that abortion is allowed in the case of [[Child sexual abuse|child rape]].<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" />

[[Dilation and curettage]] was the standard method of abortion until the 2000s, despite the [[World Health Organization]]'s recommendation of manual [[vacuum aspiration]] (MVA).<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" /> In 1988, [[University Teaching Hospital]] (UTH) and the international NGO [[Ipas (organization)|Ipas]] began a successful project to increace the hospital's capacity for abortions and introduce MVA.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=Jan |last2=Sikazwe |first2=Nsama |last3=Healy |first3=Joan |date=November–December 1991 |title=Improving Abortion Care in Zambia |jstor=1966453 |journal=[[Studies in Family Planning]] |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=391–394 |doi=10.2307/1966453 |pmid=1792679 }}</ref> In the early 1990s, NGOs supported by [[USAID]] introduced a training program, but its resource and infrastructure requirements received insufficient government support amid the [[HIV/AIDS in Zambia|AIDS epidemic]]. UTH was the only abortion facility. In 1992, the government reformed its health system to be decentralized and include an ""essential package"" of services, including MVA. This reform occurred during the peak of the Zambian AIDS epidemic, which weakened the healthcare system too much for other initiatives.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

In 2008, the MOH began a national assessment of unsafe abortion with the goal of reducing maternal mortality and meeting the U.N. [[Millennium Development Goals]]. It formed a team of legislators and representatives of the WHO and Ipas. It recommended expanding medical abortion, training mid-level providers in surgical abortion to increase access in rural areas, and drafting guidelines. Beginning in August 2009, the MOH collaborated with Ipas and UTH on a pilot project to introduce medical abortions to hospitals. It planned to implement comprehensive abortion care in 7 hospitals and 21 primary health facilities across Lusaka and [[Copperbelt Province]]. The team trained, supervised, and supplied equipment to 128 providers. In the second phase, it helped pharmacists access updated abortion drugs. It performed outreach in collaboration with the [[Planned Parenthood]] Association of Zambia and seven community-based organizations. The project lasted two years and led to 25 of the 28 facilities providing comprehensive abortion care. The others were unwilling to perform abortion services.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

The MOH's program led to an increase in providers' support for abortion and confidence in performing it. Most of the providers and pharmacists who participated agreed that they should support abortions.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" /> After [[misoprostol]] and [[mifepristone]] became available in the 25 facilities, pharmacists became more aware of these pills and more likely to provide access or information. At the time, misoprostol was widely known as an abortifacient, but over-the-counter drugs derived from it were only approved for other purposes. The misoprostol drug Cytotec was imported and was known as ""the Chinese pill"".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hendrickson |first1=Cheryl |last2=Fetters |first2=Tamara |last3=Mupeta |first3=Stephen |last4=Vwallika |first4=Bellington |last5=Djemo |first5=Patrick |last6=Raisanen |first6=Keris |date=23 October 2015 |title=Client–pharmacy worker interactions regarding medical abortion in Zambia in 2009 and 2011 |journal=[[International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics]] |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=214–218 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.07.008 |pmid=26604158 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In July 2010, mifepristone was first imported for limited use in public facilities.

Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Zambia]] protects [[fetal rights]], saying ""A person shall not deprive an unborn child of life by termination of pregnancy except in accordance with the conditions laid down by an Act of Parliament for that purpose"". In 2015, a draft for Article 28 was proposed that would say ""Every person has a right to life, which begins at conception"".<ref name=""Ngosa"">{{Cite news |last=Ngosa |first=Stanslous |date=31 March 2015 |title=Women remain in dark on abortion law |url=https://www.times.co.zm/?p=54554 |access-date=12 July 2024 |work=[[Times of Zambia]]}}</ref> The amendment was deferred for being ""contentious"" and was not included in the Constitution of Zambia Amendment Bill of 2015.<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> It was sent to a referendum that failed due to low turnout.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

Zambian nonprofits receive funding from Western nations to conduct legal abortions. After the United States [[Dobbs v.

== Prevalence ==
In 2015–2019, Zambia had an annual average of 140,000 abortions. The share of unintended pregnancies resulting in abortion was 28%, up from 19% in 1990–2004.<ref>{{Cite web |author=<!--not stated--> |date=2022 |title=Zambia country profile |url=https://www.guttmacher.org/regions/africa/zambia |access-date=12 July 2024 |website=[[Guttmacher Institute]]}}</ref> Between 2009 and 2011, the annual number of cases of abortion did not increase, but the proportion of safe, legal abortions increased from 3.2% to 7.7%.<ref name=""Leone et al"" />

A 2010 survey found that most people consider [[self-induced abortions]] or traditional healers to perform abortions, only considering public health facilities if such procedures went wrong.<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> Both clients and providers view medical abortion as more acceptable than surgical abortion.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

=== Legal abortions ===
The law requires abortions to be performed by registered medical practitioners rather than nurses. As of 2018, Zambia has one doctor per 12,000 people, making access difficult, especially in rural areas.<ref name=""CFR"" /> The law requires a signature from a specialist within a field relevant to the abortion, which further restricts access.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> Activists have argued that the requirement is unrealistic and has not resulted in access to safe abortions.<ref name=""Katongo"" /><ref name=""Ngosa"" />

As of 2013, 88 public facilities provide abortions.<ref name=""Parmar et al"" /> Abortion facilities are concentrated in [[Lusaka]]; the largest provider of abortions is the UTH.<ref name=""Freeman et al"" /> Public providers must provide abortions for no cost besides a registration fee, while private providers charge money.<ref name=""Leone et al"" /><ref name=""Parmar et al"">{{Cite journal |last1=Parmar |first1=Divya |last2=Leone |first2=Tiziana |last3=Coast |first3=Ernestina |last4=Murray |first4=Susan Fairley |last5=Hukin |first5=Eleanor |last6=Vwalika |first6=Bellington |date=27 September 2015 |title=Cost of abortions in Zambia: A comparison of safe abortion and post abortion care |journal=[[Global Public Health]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=236–249 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2015.1123747 |pmid=26708223 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/63643/ }}</ref> The registration fee is higher at UTH to incentivize seeking care at local clinics.

Conscientious objection reduces the number of safe abortion providers. The prevalence of conscientious objection is unknown, as there is no requirement to record it, but is likely high. The main reason for objection is [[Christianity and abortion|Christian ideas opposing abortion]]. Secondary motives include the ideas that women seeking abortion should have used birth control and that abortion providers' job is only to prevent harm. Non-objectors agree that abortion is against Christian morality, but believe the reasons for seeking safe abortion outweigh this. Doctors' views vary on which situations warrant abortion.<ref name=""Freeman & Coast"">{{Cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Emily |last2=Coast |first2=Ernestina |date=January 2019 |title=Conscientious objection to abortion: Zambian healthcare practitioners' beliefs and practices |journal=[[Social Science & Medicine]] |volume=221 |pages=106–114 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.12.018 |pmid=30578942 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Frederick Chiluba]]'s 1991 declaration that Zambia is a Christian nation contributed to doctors' conscientious objection.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> The stigma about abortion influences conscientious objection, as senior doctors may prevent doctors in their clinics from providing abortions, and people avoid talking about abortion publicly.<ref name=""Freeman & Coast"" />

=== Unsafe abortions ===
Many abortions in Zambia are performed by illegal practitioners, locally known as ""[[Quackery|quacks]]"". A [[University of Zambia]] study found that, in five major hospitals from 2003 to 2008, 600 women obtained legal abortions, while 52,800 women were treated for abortion complications.

[[Social norm]]s and stigma about sex, pregnancy, and abortion lead to emotional harm among women deciding whether or not to terminate their pregnancies.

Rural Zambia has low access to abortion services. Rural health bureaucrats have the job of overseeing and advising reproductive health programs. Their position is above managers of district health facilities. Bureaucrats are knowledgeable about abortion in Zambia and view it as a public health issue, though facility managers are often uninformed and their facilities do not provide abortions. The political and social sensitivity of the topic leads to many bureaucrats not discussing it outside of formal meetings. Some district health directors view abortion as an urban concern.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Haaland |first1=Marte E.

Men influence their partners who decide whether to terminate their pregnancies. Some men are not involved in their partners' pregnancies because the man denies paternity or the woman fears his response.

== Post-abortion care ==
As of 2017, between 30% and 50% of acute gynecological admissions are abortion-related.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> Due to stigma, some women receiving [[post-abortion care]] report their abortions as [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=""Leone et al"" />

At the University Teaching Hospital, the cost of post-abortion care (PAC) ranges from US$47 to $56, while a safe abortion costs between $37 and $39. The hospital spends an estimated $109,811 per year to treat unsafe abortions, thirteen times its spending on performing abortions. Nationally, the average cost of an unsafe abortion is estimated to be $52, compared to $38 for a safe abortion. Annually, the country spends between $403,000 and $3.5 million on unsafe abortions and between $221,000 and $701,000 on safe abortions. The country spent 0.2% of its health budget on PAC as of 2017.<ref name=""Parmar et al"" />

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia|COVID-19 pandemic]] led to an increase in abortion-related hospital admissions. Pandemic restrictions made it difficult to access contraceptives since people could not travel to hospitals and healthcare workers who normally distributed contraceptives were overloaded with coronavirus patients. Contraceptive distribution resumed in 2022.<ref name=""Phiri"" />

== Debate and activism ==
Some Zambians believe abortion should be banned, as it [[Christianity and abortion|violates Biblical teachings]].<ref name=""Katongo"" /> [[Christianity in Zambia|Churches in Zambia]], especially the Catholic Church and smaller churches, such as the Pentecostal Church, strongly influence the abortion debate.<ref name=""Moland et al"" /> Religious groups opposing abortion reform commonly emphasize that the current law is based on science, avoiding invoking religious arguments.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

In Zambia and other African countries, [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion-rights activists]] frame the issue in terms of public health.<ref name=""Moland et al"" /> They often avoid the term ""rights"" as it would conflict with anti-abortion activists' arguments about rights.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> Organizations such as the Society for Women and AIDS in Zambia and Youth Vision Zambia aim to address unintended pregnancies by educating citizens about [[reproductive health]].<ref name=""Katongo"" />

Due to the poor health outcomes for mothers, and the challenges to access of care there is a significant impact on the culture of birth. Diversity in language and ethnicity plays a role in the diversity of care throughout Zambia. Establishing safety for the mother and baby through national health improvement, particularly concerning infectious disease and access to clean water, is a priority for Zambia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Safe Mother Safe Babes - Home|url=https://www.safemotherssafebabies.org/|website=SAFE|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref>

Cultural beliefs during pregnancy, values and traditions can significantly affect individuals’ attitudes towards modes of delivery, their definitions of different modes, and the decisions they make in this regard. In order to develop a positive cultural and religious attitude towards vaginal delivery, women's awareness has to be raised through various ways and the existing misconceptions need to be corrected.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Latifnejad Roudsari |first1=Robab |last2=Zakerihamidi |first2=Maryam |last3=Merghati Khoei |first3=Effat |title=Socio-Cultural Beliefs, Values and Traditions Regarding Women's Preferred Mode of Birth in the North of Iran |journal=International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery |date=2015 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=165–176 |pmid=26171405 |pmc=4495324 }}</ref> While the woman is pregnant, extra precaution were taken as it is believed the women and her baby are in a physically and spiritually weaker state; this means they are more susceptible to sickness and evil forces. Preventative measures include changes in the women's nutrition. Certain foods are considered harmful to the fetus and should be avoided by the mother. For example, eating eggs while pregnant will cause the child to be born without hair. Eating fish could cause an infant abnormality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maimbolwa|first1=Margaret C.|last2=Yamba|first2=Bawa|last3=Diwan|first3=Vinod|last4=Ransjo-Arvidson|first4=Anna-Berit|date=August 2003|title=Cultural childbirth practices and beliefs in Zambia|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=263–274|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02709.x|pmid=12859785|issn=0309-2402}}</ref>

Postpartum care isn't widely accessible or accessed, but research has shown that access to antenatal care in preparation for the birth is associated with better postpartum care and contraceptive use.<ref name=do/> Use of postpartum birth control and family planning leads to better maternal health outcomes, including a reduction in the number of pregnancies, reduced transmission of STIs, and overall decreased risk for maternal mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stover|first1=John|last2=Ross|first2=John|date=2010-09-01|title=How Increased Contraceptive Use has Reduced Maternal Mortality|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=687–695|doi=10.1007/s10995-009-0505-y|pmid=19644742|s2cid=24807294|issn=1573-6628}}</ref>

Access to clean drinking water is a major concern in Zambia. 85.6% of the population in urban areas and 51.3% of the population in rural areas as access to improved water sources, and 14.4% of the urban population and 48.7% of the rural population has access to unimproved water sources. Access to sanitation facility access is unimproved in 44.4% of the urban population and 64.3% in the rural population.<ref name=wfb/>

Women are not allowed to have sexual intercourse after the eighth month of pregnancy, this is believed to prevent the baby to have “white stuff” (vernix) on their skin when they are born.<ref name=maimbolwa2003>{{cite journal |last1=Maimbolwa |first1=Margaret C. |last2=Yamba |first2=Bawa |last3=Diwan |first3=Vinod |last4=Ransjo-Arvidson |first4=Anna-Berit |title=Cultural childbirth practices and beliefs in Zambia |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |date=August 2003 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=263–274 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02709.x |pmid=12859785 }}</ref>  Furthermore, extramarital relations are believed to bring harm to the baby.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

There are certain food women are allowed to and are not allowed to eat during pregnancy and labor, as they could have a lasting effect of the child's health. For example, women are not allowed to eat eggs.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

==Labor==
Labor usually takes place in the home of the laboring women, should complications arise they are transferred to a maternity birthing center. However, due to geographic constraints sometime transportation is not an option, these geographic barriers contribute to the poor maternal health outcomes.<ref name=schmidt>Schmidt, C. (2013). Cultural Factors Exacerbating the Tragedy of Maternal Health in Zambia. 2013 NCUR.</ref>
 
Labor is meant to be a private matter between the women and a few support people, the woman will often isolate herself from those not acting as support people during her laboring. Males are also not allowed to be a part of the laboring process.<ref name=schmidt/>

Laboring mothers often behave in ways that conform to societal expectations in terms how a laboring mother should act. For example, it is the belief that mothers should not should not be vocal during the delivery process as it could lead to complications for the baby.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> 
 
Women are encouraged by their mbusa to push whenever they experience pain.  Mbusas will also utilize pieces of clothing called a chitenge to assist women into different positions, in an attempt to alleviate some of their pain.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>
 
Three to four women are allowed to be present during the labor and delivery process. These women are usually relatives or close friends such as: daughters, sisters, nieces, neighbors, and co-wives. Should a woman tell more than a few close relatives and friends she is in labor it is believed that she will become bewitched and complications will occur during the labor process.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> Laboring and mothers giving birth preferred to have someone close by acting as a support person for them, however when naming the person they want to be there, a husband or male support person is usually not named.<ref name=maimbolwa2001>{{cite journal |last1=Maimbolwa |first1=M |last2=Sikazwe |first2=N |last3=Yamba |first3=B |last4=Diwan |first4=V |last5=Ransjö-Arvidson |first5=AB |title=Views on involving a social support person during labor in zambian maternities |journal=Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health |date=August 2001 |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=226–234 |doi=10.1016/s1526-9523(01)00134-9 |pmid=11603634 }}</ref>
 
Mbusas operate under the assumption that less interference during the laboring process is better. However, at times they will employ a variety of strategies to accelerate the labor process. These include: providing fundal pressure, using a cooking stick to provide pressure in their mouth, and physically moving the mother. The gag reflex is used to help speed up either the labor process or the delivery of the placenta.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

==Birth==
Only 5.4% of births in Zambia are attended by a trained traditional birth attendant. Most laboring women will have a social support person present during the antepartum period, however if a woman gives birth in a hospital, the support person will, most likely, not be present during the actual laboring process. These women are called “mbusas”. Mbusas and those providing support during the laboring process have not received any formal education or training surround care of the laboring women. In most cases they do not have the skills needed to handle obstetrical emergencies. In those cases, they choose to accompany the laboring mothers to maternity units rather than delivering in the home.  The major roles of mbusas during the laboring process is to provide emotional support to the mother.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> 
 
When mothers are brought into maternity centers, often do not have any direction making power. Many of the mbusas and those to bring the mothers to the maternity center are often only allowed in the room during visiting hours, however many women will choose to wait outside the unit. Should a mother be able to labor at home most of the power still belongs to them throughout the whole process. Furthermore, women who give birth in a medical center are subjected to more of the “coercive obstetric procedures” these include birthing positions that are convenient for the health care provider but not the laboring women.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lambert |first1=Helen |title=Ethnocentrism: reflections on medical anthropology - Edited by Sjaak Van Der Geest & Ria Reis |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |date=June 2006 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=481–482 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2006.00303_16.x }}</ref>
 
53% of births occur in the home. The majority of the rest of the birth occur in maternity centers and hospitals. There seems to be a divide between those who gave birth in health care centers as opposed to those who gave at home. This is evidence by the fact that those who gave birth at home, do not receive as much postpartum as those who give birth in a healthcare setting. The women who choose to have a birth at home, states that they feel unwelcome at postpartum care clinics.<ref name=do/>
 
Typically in labors occurring in the home mothers are free to choose a birthing position that is most comfortable to them: some of these positions include, [[sitting]], [[kneeling]], and [[Squatting position|squatting]]. Mbusa will help with positioning through the use of a chitenge, a fabric Zambian women use to tie around the waist. Those laboring in health care centers may not have as much freedom in positioning.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> 
 
Similar to the pain experienced during labor women giving birth are encouraged to push through the pain. Typically, no pharmacological pain relief is given to mothers birthing at home and mbusas will resort to using position changes as a way to relieve some of the mother's pain.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

Once the placenta is delivered it is buried in a specific place near the house or village. It is done this way to protect the mother and her baby from witchcraft.  The placenta also plays a major role in the preservation of the women's fertility. One mbusa states: “The placenta is buried, with the side where the baby lies facing the sky, and leaving the end of the cord showing, so that when the cord drops from the baby it should be connected with the cord buried with the placenta to protect the fertility.”.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

Some women cite the feelings of embarrassment dictating their personal behaviors. In a qualitative study one woman stated: “I would feel shy to have somebody next to me because we make a lot of noise and we are not covered.”. Furthermore, with the presence of a support person women feel that their behaviors must conform strictly with societal norms, as the support person could tell others if she did not.<ref name=maimbolwa2001/>

Should a complication arise women birthing at home do not have the resources of skills to be treated at home, women are transferred to the maternity center if they are able to get there logistically. Societal norms at times can view complications or an unhealthy mother and/or baby as the fault of the mother due to her behaviors during the pregnancy or labor.

Obstetrical technology is not used in home births, this is one of the reason, home births with complications are transferred to a healthcare setting if possible. The use of technology within hospitals is also limited. For example, continuous fetal monitoring does not occur in most maternity centers.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> In hospitals the rate of episiotomies is not documented however it is estimated to be around 28%.<ref name=mackeith>{{cite journal |last1=MacKeith |first1=N. |last2=Chinganya |first2=O. J. M. |last3=Ahmed |first3=Y. |last4=Murray |first4=S. F. |title=Zambian Women's Experiences of Urban Maternity Care: Results from a Community Survey in Lusaka |journal=African Journal of Reproductive Health |date=2003 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=92–102 |doi=10.2307/3583349 |pmid=12828141 |jstor=3583349 |citeseerx=10.1.1.531.5322 }}</ref>

==Postpartum==
Once babies are born they are placed on a delivery mat until the mother delivers the placenta. The umbilical cord is then cut with a razor blade or sugar cane peel. Afterwards both the mother and the baby are bathed.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> Postpartum visits usually take place within the first 6 weeks after the birth of the child.<ref name=mackeith/>

Women who gave birth at home will then recover at home at well. There was no information about the average length of stay after a birth for women who birth in maternity centers.<ref name=Samiya>Samiya-Sumi, (2014). The Ultimate Guide to Postpartum Care: What to Do after Giving Birth | [https://www.theraply.sg/blog/post-pregnancy/the-guide-to-postpartum-care/ Postpartum Care] on September 15, 2014.</ref>

Pregnancy due dates and the start of labor are not announced as many are fearful this could evoke evil witchcraft.

There are no significant differences noticed between women who have given birth before and those who have not, the labor process seems to be approached in the same way.

One third of women who are married also use contraception. Furthermore, on average women begin to use contraception 8 months after their childbirth.<ref name=do/> After a child is born and while they are breastfeeding sexual activity is not allowed, as to protect the child.<ref name=schmidt/>

There is a large divide between those women who live in urban areas and those who live in rural areas in terms of postpartum care. Reports show that the rate of postpartum visits (up to 6 weeks after the birth of the baby) is 84% in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. As opposed to a rate of 42% of women from rural areas went to postpartum care.<ref name=do>{{cite journal |last1=Do |first1=Mai |last2=Hotchkiss |first2=David |title=Relationships between antenatal and postnatal care and post-partum modern contraceptive use: evidence from population surveys in Kenya and Zambia |journal=BMC Health Services Research |date=4 January 2013 |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=6 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-13-6 |pmid=23289547 |pmc=3545900 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Newborn==
Care for the newborn is focused mainly on superstitious issues surrounding the umbilical cord. Women dress the umbilical cord with different mixtures such as ash, seashell with oil, or breastmilk and believe that the cord dropping on the male genitals will lead to infertility.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> It is also believed that a mother should not cook until the umbilical cord has fallen off, or the mother will get a mysterious disease.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> A baby born covered in vernix is considered to be dirty. Babies are traditionally left either unwrapped, or wrapped in piece of cloth immediately after birth.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/> Skin-to-skin contact isn't always employed, unless the birth attendants have been trained to do so. These traditions may lead to hypothermia and delayed breast feeding. In hospitals and maternity centers specifically, the mothers were not encouraged to have skin to skin contact immediately following the birth of their child, nor were they encouraged to breastfeed.<ref name=maimbolwa2003/>

Due to the high maternal mortality rate of 224 deaths per 100,000 live births, many newborns are left without a mother and may therefore be orphaned and sent to an orphanage. Contributing to the high maternal mortality is access to care for mothers in need. Zambia has only 0.17 physicians and 2 hospital beds per 1,000.<ref name=wfb/> Poor maternal outcomes lead to poor newborn outcomes as well, particularly regarding the loss of a primary caregiver. The national rate of infant mortality is the 17th highest in the world at 64.72 per 1,000 live births.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Access to clean water and sanitations is a considerable concern for the health and nutrition of the mother. If mom doesn't have proper nutrition and is breastfeeding, chances are the child will be malnourished as well. In Zambia, 14.9% of children under 5 are underweight.<ref name=wfb/>

In Zambia, 8 out of 10 mothers breastfeeds exclusively for 6 months.<ref name=leach>Leach-Kemon, K. (2015). Visualizing Zambia's success with breastfeeding. Humanosphere.

Movement for baby friendly hospitals, ones that accommodate babies in the rooms with moms, promote breastfeeding, and provide lactation consultant services. Protection from HIV is another reason breastfeeding is encouraged, as exclusive breastfeeding builds the baby's immunity. Prior to the early 2000s, it was believed that HIV+ mothers should not breastfeed to avoid spreading HIV to their baby. When this was proven false and the National AIDS Council published a recommendation for HIV mothers to breastfeed their babies, breastfeeding rates began to rise again around 2007.<ref name=leach/> An advocacy campaign was launched by the Zambian ministry of health in 2009 to promote improvement of exclusive breastfeeding rate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia launches campaign to promote exclusive breastfeeding|url=https://www.unicef.org/doublepublish/zambia_48128.html|website=UNICEF|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref> They have created a video is used to promote breastfeeding. However, as noted earlier, the access to media is limited in Zambia, so alternate methods of dissemination are required. The following graphic represents the increase in coverage of exclusive breastfeeding across Zambia over 5 year increments.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Zambia is one of 22 African countries with the highest burden of undernutrition in children under five, and Micronutrient deficiencies are common in Zambian children, as vitamin A deficiencies are present in 54% of children under 5, and anemia in 53%.<ref name=unicef/> A child's nutritional status is influenced by access to food, care, and health, and poor feeding practices combined with illnesses such as intestinal parasites, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS cause this high burden of undernutrition.<ref name=unicef/> Improving the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in mothers will help to improve the nutritional issues present in children and infants.

Circumcision is generally perceived and suggested to be beneficial for reduction of STI and HIV transmission. Many religious and cultural groups have circumcision as a standard practice, but the medical circumcision movement has expanded as the understanding of the benefits has.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lukobo |first1=M.

[[Zambia]] is a landlocked, economically backward county in Africa. It is rated 166th in [[Human Development Index]] in 2006 out of a total of 177 countries based on the Human Development Report of the United Nations. By the end of 2006, a total of 39.5&nbsp;million people in the world were infected by HIV and 2.9&nbsp;million people died on account of ailments arising out of AIDS. Africa is the leader in AIDS with close to 60% of HIV victims and has been the leading cause of death in Africa.<ref>[[#Kapungwe|Kapungwe 2009]], pp. 1–2</ref>

==Statistics==
As per the [[2000 Zambian census]], the people affected by HIV or AIDS constituted 15 per cent of the population, amounting to one million, of which 60% estimated were women. The pandemic results in increased number of orphans, with an estimated 600,000 orphans in the country. It is estimated that by 2014, 974,000 children would be orphaned.<ref>{{cite book|title=Land Tenure, Housing Rights and Gender in Zambia Volume 3 of Land Tenure, Housing Rights, and Gender in [name of Country], United Nations Human Settlements Programme Law, land tenure and gender review: Southern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OmcguY-FSgC&q=zambia+census+2000&pg=PA36|pages=36–37|publisher=UN-HABITAT|isbn=9789211317749|year=2005}}</ref> The victims are high in Lusaka and Copperbelt provinces in spite of the provinces being the most urban. As per the estimate from 2006, the HIV positive cases is 5 per cent in the age group 15–19 years, 25 per cent from 30 to 34 years and 17% from 45 to 49 years. HIV was more prevalent in urban areas compared to rural areas.<ref>[[#Kapungwe|Kapungwe 2009]], p. 3</ref>

==Causes==
The primary modes of HIV transmission are through sex, intravenous drug use and mother-to-child transmission. HIV prevalence rates vary considerably within the country. Infection rates are highest in cities and towns along major transportation routes and lower in rural areas with low population density. HIV prevalence among pregnant women can range from less than 10 percent in some areas to 30 percent in others. In general, however, young women ages 25 to 34 are at much higher risk of being infected by HIV than young men in the same age group. The prevalence rates are 12.7 and 3.8 percent, respectively.<ref name =""huachen"" /> Risk for the disease is higher for people with sensory, intellectual, physical and psychosocial disabilities, despite the [[2012 Persons with Disabilities Act]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Zambia: People With Disabilities Left Behind in HIV Response|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/15/zambia-people-disabilities-left-behind-hiv-response|access-date=19 July 2014|agency=Human Rights Watch|date=15 July 2014}}</ref> Other at-risk populations include [[Soldier|military personnel]], people in prostitution, [[truck driver]]s, and people who work in [[Fishery|fisheries]]. Although [[men who have sex with men]] have a higher risk of HIV transmission than those who do not, the government-operated National AIDS Control Program does not address [[LGBT rights in Zambia|same-sex relationships]].<ref name=""huachen"">{{cite report|title=LGBT in Zambia|url=http://huachen.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/LGBTShadow_Zambia.pdf|year=2011|publisher=Huachen.org|access-date=15 October 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205609/http://huachen.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/LGBTShadow_Zambia.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2008}}</ref> While Zambia's national prevalence rate remains high and shows no sign of declining, the country has been noted for its significant increases in [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral treatment (ART)]] access.<ref name=us/>

==Measures==
The government of Zambia created an AIDS surveillance committee as early as 1986 and created an emergency plan to control the spread by 1987. As per the plan, all [[blood transfusion]] should be screened for HIV. By 2002, the government created a mission to make [[antiretroviral therapy]] available for every individual. By 2005, the government made antiretroviral therapy free for every individual.<ref>[[#Kapungwe|Kapungwe 2009]], p. 9</ref>

With about one million Zambians living with HIV/AIDS and 200,000 of these persons requiring ART, the Government of the Republic of Zambia has prioritized making ART available to all Zambians in need. A 2006 rapid assessment of the Zambian ART program identified several important constraints including: inadequate human resources for counseling, testing, and treatment-related care; gaps in supply of drugs in the public sector; increase in value of the [[Zambian kwacha]]; lack of adequate [[Logistics|logistic]]/supply chain systems; stigma that hinders people from seeking treatment and care; lack of information on the availability of treatment services; a high level of misinformation about ART; need for a continuous funding stream as an accumulation of patients on ART results in a growing need for support; high cost of ART to patients, despite subsidies from the public sector; lack of referral between counseling and testing services and ART; and lack of referral between home-based care services, testing and ART.<ref name=us>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepfar.gov/pepfar/press/81694.htm |title=2008 Country Profile: Zambia|publisher= [[U.S. Department of State]] |year=2008|access-date= 25 August 2008}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

ZEPRS,"{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2022}}
The '''Zambia Electronic [[Perinatal]] Record System''' ('''ZEPRS''') is an [[Electronic medical record|Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR) system used by public [[obstetric]] clinics and a hospital (the University Teaching Hospital) in [[Lusaka]], Zambia.

== Background ==
In early 2001 a team of physicians at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB) and visiting Zambian physician Dr. Moses Sinkala conceived the idea based on a successful electronic perinatal record system that the UAB had developed and proven in clinics in [[Birmingham alabama|Birmingham]]. In July 2001, the [[Gates foundation|Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] awarded a grant to the UAB to develop a similar system to serve public obstetric clinics in Lusaka, Zambia.<ref name=""GatesPresRelease"">[http://www.gatesfoundation.org/GlobalHealth/Pri_Diseases/ReproductiveMaternalHealth/Announcements/Announce-403.htm 1] US-Zambian Collaboration Receives $4 Million To Establish Electronic Obstetric And Newborn Medical Record In Lusaka, Zambia</ref>

The UAB team solicited proposals for the technical design and implementation of the system from several private sector information technology firms, including [[Electronic Data Systems]], before awarding a contract to RTI International (RTI), a large [[501(c)(3)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)3]] not-for-profit research organization based in [[Research Triangle Park]], [[North Carolina]]. Other project partners included the [[CIDRZ|Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia]] (CIDRZ), and the Lusaka District Health Management Team of the Zambian Central Board of Health.

== Objectives ==
ZEPRS was designed to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes by:

# Improving perinatal care for women and postnatal care for neonates by:
## Promoting adherence to good standard of care practices
## Identifying and document potential medical/ obstetrical problems so that effective therapies can be administered
## Improving communication and referrals among providers
## Enhancing monitoring and evaluation of outcomes, clinics, and providers
# Improving efficiency, completeness, accuracy of documentation and reporting

== Major components ==
ZEPRS achieves these objectives by providing the following:

* An electronic patient record system with patient record database shared among facilities
* A system that guides clinicians through the Zambian standard of care
* Intelligent rules that alert clinicians to problems and recommend patient referral when appropriate
* Standard & ad hoc reporting for supportive supervision, surveillance, and analysis
* An electronic-first system used by clinicians during the course of patient care
* An electronic referral system to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of referrals

ZEPRS components include a voice and data wireless network that interconnects facilities; wired and wireless networks within facilities; a data center managed by CIDRZ; and an electronic perinatal record system with integrated patient referral system.

ZEPRS uses a tabbed user interface and [[Role-based access control|role-based access control system]] to enable several clinicians to share the same computer to retrieve and enter data for different patients.

== Software architecture ==
ZEPRS has been developed using the [[Java programming language]]. Other technologies used include [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], Quartz, [[Mysql|MySQL]], and others. ZEPRS has its own content management system called DynaSite, that makes it easy to add forms, fields, form flows, and business rules without programming. RTI has developed a locally installable version of the software using the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] [[Rich Client Platform]] (RCP) and the [[Apache Derby]] embedded database. This version uses the free and open source Zcore platform, which uses an implementation of [[RSS]] to transmit data over intermittent networks, such as mobile phone networks.

== Development history ==
RTI worked with South African firm Communications Solutions (Comsol) to conduct a wireless site survey of all facilities, and to design a line-of-sight wireless network to connect them. By March 2003 this network was operational. Before the end of 2003 RTI had worked with Comsol to add [[VOIP|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) to provide voice communication between facilities, and had extended the network to connect multiple buildings in clinic compounds and to multiple wards of the University Teaching Hospital.

Three to nine networked [[Personal computer|PC]]s and one laser printer were installed in each clinic, as well as additional PCs and printers in the University Teaching Hospital and administrative offices. The ZEPRS data center was installed at CIDRZ, which housed the combined ZEPRS technical support team.

Approximately 800 clinicians, many of whom had never used a computer, were trained in basic computer literacy. Standard clinical protocol reference works and email were made available to clinicians electronically over the ZEPRS network.

By early May 2004 RTI had completed an [[Open-source software|open source]] electronic patient referral system. This was launched into production use in clinics on 22 June 2004. Clinicians adopted this component readily and the system was soon rolled out to all 24 clinics and the University Teaching Hospital.

Also in May 2004, CIDRZ asked RTI whether the ZEPRS software could be adapted to help in managing [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral therapy]] (ART) to treat patients infected with the [[HIV|Human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Version 1.0 of this software, the ART Patient Tracking System (ART/PTS), was launched into use at Kalingalinga Clinic on 1 June 2004.<ref name=""art_pts_article_jama"">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.296.7.782 |title=Rapid Scale-up of Antiretroviral Therapy at Primary Care Sites in Zambia: Feasibility and Early Outcomes |year=2006 |last1=Stringer |first1=J.

RTI reviewed the completed [[Software release life cycle#Beta|Beta]] version of the fully integrated perinatal record system with the UAB team in July 2005, and released Version 1.0 on 21 November 2005. This version was pilot tested in a limited number of clinics in Lusaka from December 2005 through January 2006. ZEPRS was launched into production use in two clinics in February 2006. The system was rolled out to all clinics at the average rate of one clinic each month until the roll out was completed in August 2007.

== Current status ==
Since roll out was completed in August 2007, ZEPRS has been used by 24 public obstetrics clinics, as well as six  wards (blocks A-D, adult ARV ward, and pediatric ARV ward) within the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. The ZEPRS patient record database has been used since February 2006 for routine health surveillance, monitoring, and supervision of health care. A 2006 study cited the use of a ZEPRS-based patient record system as one of four key factors in the successful rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy at primary care sites in Zambia.<ref name=""art_pts_article_jama"" />

By September 2011 ZEPRS contained medical records for more than 510,000 patients and ZEPRS had been used to manage multiple pregnancies for more than 20,000 mothers. In 2011 an average of more than 8,000 new antenatal patients were being registered in the system each month and the system was being used by 278 individual users.<ref name=""zeprs_stats"">Data based on queries of the ZEPRS database performed on 9 September 2011.</ref> Clinicians in 25 facilities have used ZEPRS to manage perinatal care during more than 7.7 million patient encounters with more than 770,000 patients and during more than 335,000 deliveries.<ref name=""zeprs_stats_2"">Data based on queries of the ZEPRS database performed on 23 July 2014.</ref>

Information regarding the impact of ZEPRS on the quality of health care and health outcomes can be obtained by contacting the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia or the Zambian Central Board of Health.

== Ongoing development ==
Since ZEPRS was launched in February 2006 it has been continually refined and enhanced based on input from clinicians and emerging needs. In 2008 RTI worked with CIDRZ to implement an interface with the [[Laboratory information management system|Laboratory Information Management System]] (LMIS) at Kalingalinga Clinic, enabling lab test results such as [[CD4]] counts to be transferred to patient records automatically twice daily. RTI has developed a version of the software that can be installed locally, be used within a facility in the absence of network connectivity, and can synchronize records automatically when connectivity is detected. This version is based on the free and open source Zcore platform, which can transmit data automatically over intermittent networks, such as mobile phone networks.

== Adaptability ==
The Zcore software platform that emerged from ZEPRS has been used for managing pharmaceutical supplies in health centers in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, managing malaria indoor residual spraying operations in Kenya, and managing medical and legal care for rape survivors in South Africa.

{{History of Zambia}}
The '''history of Zambia''' experienced many stages from [[colonisation]] to independence from Britain on 24 October 1964.
[[Northern Rhodesia]] became a British [[sphere of influence]] in the present-day region of Zambia in 1888, and was officially proclaimed a British [[protectorate]] in 1924. After many years of suggested mergers, [[Southern Rhodesia]], Northern Rhodesia, and [[Nyasaland]] were merged into the British [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]].

In 1960, the British prime minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], declared that the age of colonial rule in Africa was ending. Finally, in December 1963, the federation was dissolved, and the [[Zambia|Republic of Zambia]] was formed out of Northern Rhodesia on 23 October 1964.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia Gains its Independence From the U.K. |url=https://aaregistry.org/story/zambia-gains-independence/ |access-date=2022-04-17 |website=African American Registry |language=en}}</ref>

[[Archaeological excavation]] work on the [[Zambezi Valley]] and [[Kalambo Falls]] show a succession of human cultures. In particular, ancient camping site tools near the [[Kalambo Falls]] have been radiocarbon dated to more than 36,000 years ago.

The Khoisan, and more especially the Twa, formed a [[patron-client relationship]] with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups.

==Bantu (Abantu)==
{{Update|section|date=May 2025|reason=Dated scholarship}}
The Bantu people or Abantu (meaning people) are an enormous and diverse [[ethnolinguistic group]] that comprise the majority of people in much of [[East Africa|East]], [[Southern Africa|Southern]] and [[Central Africa]]. Due to Zambia's location at the crossroads of [[Central Africa]], [[Southern Africa]], and the [[African Great Lakes]], the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions.

Many of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously. Thus, Zambia's history, like many African nation's histories, cannot be presented perfectly chronologically. The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records, archaeology, and written records mostly from non-Africans.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Scott D.|title=Culture and Customs of Zambia|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/scott_d._taylor_culture_and_customs_of_zambia_cbook4you.pdf|publisher=Greenwood Press|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref>

===Bantu origins===
The Bantu people originally lived in [[West Africa|West]]/[[Central Africa]] around what is today [[Cameroon]]/[[Nigeria]]. Around 4000 to 3000 years ago, they began a millennia-long expansion into much of the continent. This event has been called the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu Expansion]], which was one of the largest human migrations in history. The Bantu are believed to have been the first to have brought [[Ferrous metallurgy|iron working]] technology into large parts of Africa. The Bantu Expansion happened primarily through two routes: one was western via the [[Congo Basin]] and the other was eastern via the African Great Lakes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bostoen|first=Koen|date=2018-04-26|title=The Bantu Expansion|url=https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-191|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.191|isbn=978-0-19-027773-4}}</ref>

===First Bantu settlement===
[[File:Ba-Ila man.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ila people|Ila]] Headman's son in Southern Zambia, Cattle formed an important part of their society.]]

According to recent scholarship by Nicholas Katanekwa, the earliest Bantu people in Zambia were the ""New Kalundu"" culture, arriving from the west along the Zambezi valley from the fourth century CE. These groups are associated with Guthrie group R, as well as the ancestors of the Shona, Venda, ans especially Mbwela peoples.
The next Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes.[[File:Ba-ila Village.jpg|thumb|Enormous [[Ila people|Ba-Ila]] settlement. These communities have been of interest to mathematicians due to their [[Fractal|fractal pattern]] design.]] They arrived later in the 1st millennium AD. Among them were the [[Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe|Tonga people]] (also called Ba-Tonga, ""Ba-"" meaning ""men"") and the [[Ila people|Ba-Ila]] and other related groups who settled around [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]] near [[Zimbabwe]]. According to Ba-Tonga oral records, they are believed to have come from the east near the ""big sea"".

They were later joined by the [[Tumbuka people|Ba-Tumbuka]] who settled around [[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Zambia]] and [[Malawi]].

These first Bantu people lived in large villages. They never had an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and help each other in times of field preparation for their crops. Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted due to using the [[slash-and-burn]] technique of planting crops. They also kept large herds of cattle which formed an important part of their societies.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-12|title=Ila|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/early-bantu-settlers/ila/|access-date=2020-10-27|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref>

The first Bantu communities in Zambia were extremely self-sufficient. Many groups of people who encountered them were very impressed by this self-sufficiency. The early [[Missionary|European missionaries]] that settled in [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]] also noted the extreme independence of these Bantu societies, one of these missionaries noted:[[File:Ingombe.jpg|thumb|[[Ingombe Ilede]] trading post in Southern Zambia.]]

<blockquote>""[If] weapons for war, hunting, and domestic purposes are needed, the [Tonga] man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore. He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes, hoes, and other useful implements. He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge. His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile, and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained. He moulds, welds, shapes, and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith.""<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of South and South Central Africa, by H.

These early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site [[Ingombe Ilede]] (which translate sleeping cow in [[Chitonga|Chi-Tonga]] because the fallen baobab tree appears to resembles a cow) in [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Zambia]], at this trading site they met numerous [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]]/[[Shona people|Shona]] traders from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders from the East African [[Swahili coast|Swahili Coast]]. Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe, others being the Swahili port cities like of [[Sofala]].

The goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included: fabrics, beads, gold, and bangles. Some of these items came from what is today southern [[the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] while others as far away as [[India]], [[China]] and the [[Arab world|Arab World]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Origins of trade - Zambia Travel Guide|url=http://www.zambia-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1084|access-date=2020-10-28|website=www.zambia-travel-guide.com}}</ref> The African traders were later joined by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pikirayi|first=Innocent|date=August 2017|title=Ingombe Ilede and the demise of Great Zimbabwe|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=91|issue=358|pages=1085–1086|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.95|s2cid=158120419|issn=0003-598X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The decline of Great Zimbabwe, due to increasing trade competition from other [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]]/[[Shona people|Shona]] kingdoms like [[Khami]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]], spelt the end of [[Ingombe Ilede]].

===Further Bantu settlement===
The third mass settlement of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]] into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the central-western route of the Bantu migration through the [[Congo Basin]]. These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-08|title=Luba|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|access-date=2020-11-07|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref> [[File:(Kibango) Luba peoples The Metropolitan Museum of Art.png|left|thumb|Seated female Staffs of office (Kibango), were displayed by [[Luba people|Luba]] kings. In Luba society, women's bodies were considered the ultimate vessels of spiritual power.]]

While it was previously speculated that the [[Bemba people]] or [[Bemba people|AbaBemba]] have a strong ancient connection to the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo Kingdom]] through [[Kongo people|BaKongo]] ruler [[Manikongo|Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba]] this, is not supported by evidence.

'''Luba-Lunda States''' [[File:Brooklyn Museum 76.20.4 Lukasa Memory Board.jpg|thumbnail|[[Lukasa]] memory board, was used by members of Mbudye (an association of [[Griot|groits]] in charge of maintaining Baluba history)]]

The Bemba, along with other related groups like the [[Lamba people (Zambia)|Lamba]], [[Lala-Bisa language|Bisa]], [[Senga people|Senga]], [[Kaonde language|Kaonde]], [[Swaka language|Swaka]], [[Nkoya]] and [[Soli language|Soli]], formed integral parts of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the [[Luba people|BaLuba people]]. The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and iron-workers since the 300's AD. Over time these communities learned to use [[Fishing net|nets]], [[harpoon]]s, make [[dugout canoe]]s, clear [[canal]]s through swamps and make [[dam]]s as high as 2.5 meters.

As a result, they grew a [[Economic diversity|diverse economy]] trading fish, copper and iron items, and salt for goods from other parts of [[Africa]] like the [[Swahili coast|Swahili Coast]] and, later on, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. From these communities arose the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] in the 14th century.<ref name=""metmuseum.org"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|title=Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Luba and Lunda Empires|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.metmuseum.org|date=October 2003 }}</ref>

The Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a [[Centralized government|centralised government]] and smaller independent [[chiefdom]]s. It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the [[Congo Basin]] and the mineral-rich plateaus of what is today [[Copperbelt Province]] and stretched from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] to the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean Coast]]. The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom and artisans where held in high regards.<ref name=""metmuseum.org""/> [[File:Mwata.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the ruler of Lunda, [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]], receiving Portuguese in the royal courtyard in the 1800s]]

The [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba Kingdom]] literature was also well developed. One renowned [[Luba people|Luba]] genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors as follows:

<blockquote>""[[Kongolo Mwamba|Nkongolo Mwamba]], the red king, and [[Ilunga Mbili|Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe]], a prince of legendary black complexion. Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot, Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe, the refined and gentle prince. Nkongolo the red is a man without manners, a man who eats in public, gets drunk, and cannot control himself, whereas [Ilunga] Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation, obsessed with good manners; he does not eat in public, controls his language and his behaviour, and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people. Nkongolo Mwamba symbolizes the embodiment of tyranny, whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin.""<ref>{{Cite web|title=Luba {{!}} people|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Luba-people|access-date=2020-11-07|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref></blockquote> [[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of Lunda houses by a Portuguese. The size of the doorways relative to the building emphasizes the scale of the buildings.]]

In the same region of Southern Congo the [[Lunda people]] were made into a satellite of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba empire]] and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance and thus became the [[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda empire]] to the south. According to Lunda genesis myths, a Luba hunter named [[Tshibinda Ilunga|Chibinda Ilunga]] son of [[Ilunga Mbili|Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe]] introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around 1600 when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom. Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire. The Lunda kings, however, remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region.<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/luba/hd_luba.htm|title=Kingdoms of the Savanna: The Luba and Lunda Empires|access-date=2020-11-29|website=www.metmuseum.org|date=October 2003 }}</ref>[[File:Young-awemba-girls-1932-bemba.webp|thumb|Young [[Bemba people|Bemba]] girls. AbaBemba women made and adorned jewellery for beauty and belonging in their culture.]]

The Lunda, like its parent state Luba, also traded with both coasts, the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]. With ruler [[List of rulers of the Lunda Empire|Mwaant Yaav Naweej]] had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] and forest products and controlling the regional [[Copper|copper trade]], and settlements around [[Lake Mweru]] regulated commerce from the [[Swahili coast|East African coast]].<ref name=""ReferenceA""/>

The [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba-Lunda states]] eventually declined as a result of both [[Atlantic slave trade]] in the west and [[Indian Ocean slave trade]] in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms. The [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], a group that is highly related to the [[Luvale people|Luvale]] and formed a Lunda satellite state, initially suffered from the European demand for slaves but once the broke away from the Lunda State, they defeated the previous parent state and became notorious slave traders, exporting slaves to both coasts. The Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Azuonye|first=Chukwuma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ejao3vG6nfsC&pg=PA11|title=Chokwe: (Angola, Zambia)|date=1996-12-15|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc|isbn=978-0-8239-1990-1|language=en}}</ref>

This instability caused the collapse of the Luba-Lunda States and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba-Lunda and surrounding Central African states.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-08|title=Luba|url=https://traditionalzambia.home.blog/tribes-of-zambia/second-bantu-invasion/luba/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Zambia's Traditional History|language=en}}</ref>

'''Maravi Confederacy''' 
[[File:Nyau-mask.webp|thumb|This type of elaborately feathered [[Nyau]] mask was used for the recall of spirits. It is called Nchawa.]]
In the 1200s, before the founding of the Luba-Lunda states, a group of Bantu people started migrating from the [[Congo Basin|Congo basin]] to [[Lake Mweru]] then finally settled around [[Lake Malawi]]. These migrants are believed to have been one of the inhabitants around the [[Upemba Depression|Upemba]] area in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. By the 1400s these groups of migrants collectively called the Maravi, most prominently among them was the [[Chewa people]], started assimilating other Bantu groups like the [[Tumbuka people|Tumbuka]].<ref name=""Team"">{{Cite web|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=2018-12-26|title=The Maravi Confederacy|url=https://thinkafrica.net/maravi-confederacy/|access-date=2020-12-13|website=Think Africa|language=en-US}}</ref>[[File:Kalonga.jpg|thumb|left|The Kalonga of the [[Chewa people|Chewa]] today descends from the Kalonga (rulers) of the Maravi Empire.]]

In 1480 the [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]] was founded by the Kalonga (paramount chief of the Maravi) from the Phiri clan one of the main clans with the others being Banda, Mwale and Nkhoma. The Maravi Empire stretched from the [[Indian Ocean]] through what today is [[Mozambique]] to Zambia and large parts of [[Malawi]]. The political organization of the Maravi resembled the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba]] and is believed to have originated from there, the primary export of the Maravi was Ivory which was transported to Swahili brokers.<ref name=""Team""/>

Iron was also manufactured and exported. In the 1590s the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] endeavoured to [[monopoly|monopolize]] the Maravi export trade. This attempt was met with outrage by the Maravi of Lundu who released their WaZimba armed force. The WaZimba sacked the Portuguese trade towns of Tete, Sena and various other towns.<ref name=""Team""/>

The Maravi are also believed to have brought the traditions that would become [[Nyau|Nyau secret society]] from the [[Upemba Depression|Upemba]]. The Nyau form the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people of Maravi. The [[Nyau]] society consists of ritual dance performances and masks used for the dances, this belief system spread around the region.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maptia|title=The Secret Cult of Nyau Dancers|url=https://maptia.com/vlad_sokhin/stories/the-secret-cult-of-nyau-dancers|access-date=2021-01-03|website=Maptia|language=en|archive-date=2020-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108130415/https://maptia.com/vlad_sokhin/stories/the-secret-cult-of-nyau-dancers|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Maravi went into decline due to succession disputes within the confederacy, attack by the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] and slave raids from the [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]].<ref name=""Team""/>

As [[Great Zimbabwe]] was in decline. One of its princes, [[Nyatsimba Mutota]], broke away from the state forming a new empire called [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]]. The title of [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mwene Mutapa]], meaning ""Ravager of the Lands"", was bestowed on him and subsequent rulers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mwene Matapa {{!}} historical dynastic title, southern Africa|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mwene-Matapa|access-date=2020-12-31|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] ruled territory between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Limpopo]] rivers, in what is now Zambia, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]], from the 14th to the 17th century. By its peak, Mutapa had conquered the Dande area of the [[Tonga people (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]] and Tavara. The Mutapa Empire predominately engaged in the [[Indian Ocean]] transcontinental trade with and via the [[Swahili people|WaSwahili]]. They primary exported gold and ivory for silk and ceramics from Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mutapa|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Mutapa/|access-date=2020-12-31|website=[[World History Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>

Like their contemporaries in [[Maravi]], Mutapa had problems with the arriving [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders. The peak of this uneasy relationship was reached when the Portuguese attempted to influence the kingdoms internal affairs by establishing markets in the kingdom and converting the population to [[Christianity]]. This action caused outrage by the [[Muslim]] WaSwahili living in the capital. This chaos gave the Portuguese the excuse they were searching for to warrant an attack on the kingdom and try to control its gold mines and ivory routes. This attack failed when the Portuguese succumbed to disease along the [[Zambezi|Zambezi river]].<ref name=""Mutapa"">{{Cite web|title=Mutapa|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Mutapa/|access-date=2021-01-01|website=[[World History Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>

In the 1600s, internal disputes and civil war began the decline of [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa]]. The weakened kingdom was finally conquered by the Portuguese and was eventually taken over by rival [[Shona people|Shona]] states.<ref name=""Mutapa""/>[[File:Litunga.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the palace of the [[Litunga]], ruler of the Lozi. Due to the flooding on the Zambezi, the Litunga has two palaces one of which is on higher ground. The movement of Litunga to higher land is celebrated at the [[Kuomboka|Kuomboka Ceremony]]]]

It is hypothesised by [[Julian Cobbing]] that the presence of early [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] [[History of slavery|slave trading]] and attempts to control resources in various parts of [[Bantu languages|Bantu Speaking Africa]] caused the gradual [[militarization]] of the people in the region. This can be observed with the Maravi's WaZimba warrior cast who, once defeating the Portuguese, remained quite militaristic afterwards.

The Portuguese presence in the region was also a major reason for the founding of the [[Rozvi Empire]], a breakaway state of Mutapa. The ruler of the Rozvi, [[Changamire Dombo]], became one of the most powerful leaders in South-Central Africa's history. Under his leadership, the Rozvi defeated the Portuguese and expelled them from their trading posts along the Zambezi river.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rozwi {{!}} historical state, Africa|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rozwi-historical-state-Africa|access-date=2021-01-02|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>[[File:Makishi.jpg|thumb|[[Makishi festival|Makishi]] dancer, found in [[North-Western Province, Zambia|North-Western Zambia]], represent spirits of a deceased who returns to assist the living]]

But perhaps the most notable instance of this increased militarization was the rise of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] under the leadership of [[Shaka]]. Pressures from the [[English people|English colonialists]] in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] and increased militarization of the Zulu resulted in the [[Mfecane]] (the crushing). The Zulu expanded by assimilating the women and children of tribes they defeated, if the men of these [[Nguni people|Nguni tribes]] escaped slaughter, they used the military tactics of the Zulu to attack other groups.<ref name=""Mfecane {{!}} African history"">{{Cite web|title=Mfecane {{!}} African history|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Mfecane|access-date=2021-01-02|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

This caused mass displacements, wars and raids throughout Southern, Central and Eastern Africa as [[Nguni people|Nguni]] or [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] tribes made their way throughout the region and is referred to as the [[Mfecane]]. The arriving [[Nguni people|Nguni]] under the leadership of [[Zwangendaba|Zwagendaba]] crossed the Zambezi river moving northwards. The Ngoni were the final blow to the already weakened [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]]. Many Nguni eventually settled around what is today Zambia, [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]] and assimilated into neighboring tribes.<ref name=""Mfecane {{!}} African history""/>

In the [[Western Province, Zambia|western part]] of [[Zambia]], another [[Southern Africa]]n group of [[Sotho-Tswana peoples|Sotho-Tswana]] heritage called the [[Kololo people|Kololo]] manage to conquer the local inhabitants who were migrants from the fallen [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba]] and [[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda states]] called the [[Luyana language|Luyana]] or Aluyi. The Luyana established the [[Barotseland|Barotse Kingdom]] on the [[Barotse Floodplain|floodplains of the Zambezi]] upon their arrival from Katanga. Under the Kololo, the Kololo language was imposed upon the Luyana until the Luyana revolted and overthrew the Kololo by this time the Luyana language was largely forgotten and a new hybrid language emerged, [[Lozi language|SiLozi]] and the Luyana began to refer to themselves as [[Lozi people|Lozi]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lozi {{!}} people|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lozi|access-date=2021-01-02|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

==Colonial period==
[[Image:CecilRhodes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cecil Rhodes]]]]

{{main|Northern Rhodesia}}

In 1888, [[Cecil Rhodes]] who was spearheading British commercial and political interests in [[Central Africa]], obtained a mineral rights concessions from local chiefs. In the same year, Northern and Southern [[Rhodesia]], now [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], were proclaimed a British [[sphere of influence]]. In the beginning, the territory was administered by Rhodes' [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC), which showed little interest in the province and used it mainly as a source of labour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History|url=https://www.szi.gov.zm/epamodzi/?page_id=4114|website=Republic of Zambia e-Pamodzi portal|access-date=2020-05-28|archive-date=2019-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607000649/http://www.szi.gov.zm/epamodzi/?page_id=4114|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The most important factor in the colony's economy was copper. The discovery of which is due partly to an American scout, [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], who in 1895 led and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which established that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa.<ref name=""baxter1970"">{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=T.W. |author2=E.E.

In 1923 the British government decided not to renew the company's [[charter]]. As a result, [[Southern Rhodesia]] was annexed formally and granted self-government in 1923. After negotiations, the administration of [[Northern Rhodesia]] was transferred to the British [[Colonial Office]] in 1924 as a [[protectorate]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia (01/09)|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2359.htm|last=Department Of State.

[[File:Flag of Northern Rhodesia (1939–1964).svg|thumb|left|Flag of [[Northern Rhodesia]]]]

In 1928, enormous [[copper]] deposits were discovered in the region which then became known as the [[Copperbelt]]. This transformed Northern Rhodesia from a prospective land of colonization for white farmers to a copper exporter. By 1938, the country produced 13% of the world's copper extraction. The sector was developed by two companies: the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American Corporation]] (AAC) and the South African [[Rhodesian Selection Trust]] (RST), who controlled the sector until independence.

The poor safety record and increased taxes triggered a [[Strike action|strike]] of African mineworkers in 1935,<ref>{{Cite book |jstor=j.ctv6mtdm4.10 |jstor-access=free |chapter=The Politicization of Black Labor |last1=Parpart |first1=Jane L. |last2=Freund |first2=Bill |title=Labor and Capital on the African Copperbelt |year=1983 |pages=54–74 |publisher=Temple University Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctv6mtdm4.10 }}</ref> also known as the [[Copperbelt strike (1935)|Copperbelt strike]]. The strike was crushed by the authorities and six miners were killed.<ref name=""britannica.com""/>

During the [[Second World War]], white miners came out on strike in 1940. Realizing the importance of their products for the war, they demanded higher salaries. This strike was followed by another by African mine workers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Southern Africa - European and African interaction in the 19th century {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Southern-Africa/European-and-African-interaction-in-the-19th-century |access-date=2022-05-26 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Rodésia e Niassalândia 32.jpg|thumb|Stamp with portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], 1955]]
Even before the war, there had been talks about merging the two Rhodesias, but the process had been halted by the British authorities, and brought to an absolute stop by the war. Finally, in 1953, both Rhodesias were joined with [[Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]) to form the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Central African Federation]]. Northern Rhodesia was the centre of much of the turmoil and crises that afflicted the federation in its last years. At the core of the controversy were insistent African demands for greater participation in government and European fears of losing political control.<ref name=""britannica.com""/>

A [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1962|two-stage election]] held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-b under a new constitution, and a new national assembly based on a broader, more democratic franchise. On 31 December 1963, the federation was dissolved, and [[Northern Rhodesia]] became the [[Republic of Zambia]] on [[Zambia Independence Act 1964|24 October 1964]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History|url=https://www.nws.gov.zm/?page_id=4385|last=Provincial administration|access-date=2020-05-28|archive-date=2020-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930150655/https://www.nws.gov.zm/?page_id=4385|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Independence==
[[Image:Zambia Ind000.jpg|thumb|right|A book published by the government upon independence]]

At independence, despite its considerable mineral wealth, Zambia faced major challenges. Domestically, there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government,<ref>There were only eight indigenous Graduates in the country at Independence</ref> and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise. Most of Zambia's neighbouring countries were still [[colony|colonies]] or under white [[minority rule]].

The [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) won the [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1964|pre-independence elections]], gaining 55 of the 75 seats. The [[Zambian African National Congress]] won 10 seats, and the [[National Progressive Party (Zambia)|National Progressive Party]] won all the 10 seats reserved for whites.<ref name=""elections"">{{cite web

}}</ref> [[Kenneth Kaunda]] was elected [[Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia|Prime Minister]], and later the same year president, as the country adopted a presidential system.

Kaunda adopted an [[ideology]] of [[African socialism]], close to that of [[Julius Nyerere]] in [[Tanzania]]. Economical policies focused on [[central planning]] and [[nationalisation]], and a system of [[one party rule]] was put in place.

===Towards one-party rule===
In 1968 Kaunda was [[Zambian general election, 1968|re-elected as president]]. During the following years, Zambia adopted a one party system. In 1972 all political parties except UNIP were banned, and this was formalized in a new constitution that was adopted in 1973. The constitution framed a system called ""one-party participatory democracy"", which in practice, meant that UNIP became the sole political factor in the country. It provided for a strong [[President of Zambia|president]] and a [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]]. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of UNIP. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy. In legislative elections, only candidates running for UNIP were allowed to participate. Even though inter-party competition was out of question, the contest for seats within UNIP was energetic. In the presidential elections, the only candidate allowed to run was the one elected as president of UNIP at the party's general conference. In this way Kaunda was re-elected unopposed with a yes or no vote in [[Zambian general election, 1973|1973]], [[Zambian general election, 1978|1978]], [[Zambian general election, 1983|1983]] and [[Zambian general election, 1988|1988]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=1973-12-07 |title=Kaunda, Unopposed, Re-elected Zambian President for 3d Term |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/07/archives/kaunda-unopposed-reelected-zambian-president-for-3d-term-antikaunda.html |access-date=2022-05-29 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[File:Chisembele, S.M..jpg|thumb|right|S.M Chisembele, Cabinet Minister, Western Province]]
This did not, however, mean that there was no dissension to the imposition of a one-party rule in the country or within UNIP. [[Sylvester Mwamba Chisembele]] who was Cabinet Minister for Western Province (previously Barotse Province) together with UNIP leaders from 7 out of the 8 Provinces established a Committee of 14. The objective of the Committee of 14 which consisted two leaders from each of the 7 provinces was the establishment of a democratically elected council of two leaders from each province to rule the country by consensus with the President as Head of State. If this had been achieved, it would have meant the curtailing of the absolute power residing in President Kaunda. The Committee of 14 attended a meeting in State House at which President Kaunda agreed to consider their proposals. However, later he banned the Committee of 14 and this action was followed by the suspension of Sylvester Chisembele and several leaders were sacked.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Zambia Daily Mail|date=21 April 1971}}</ref> Chisembele later rejoined the Cabinet as Minister for Eastern Province and two years later in 1977 he was transferred in the same position to the Copperbelt Province, where the political situation was tense, especially so because of the forthcoming General Elections. Simon M. Kapwepwe and Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula, who, before the declaration of a One Party State, had been leaders of the UPP and ANC political parties respectively, had joined UNIP with the intention of challenging for the Presidency. However, their attempt to challenge President Kaunda for the Presidency on the UNIP ticket failed as both were prevented and disqualified by the manipulations of President Kaunda, who stood unopposed. Simon Kapwepwe and Harry Nkumbula challenged the resultant 1978 election of President Kaunda in the High Court, but unsurprisingly their action was unsuccessful.

===Economy and the copper crisis===
After independence, Zambia adopted a [[Left (politics)|left]]-wing economic policy. The economy was, to some extent, run by central planning under five year plans. Private companies were [[nationalised]] and incorporated into large state-owned conglomerates. The government's goal was to be self-sufficient, which it sought to achieve through [[import substitution]]. At first, the plan worked and the economy grew steadily. However, in the mid-1970s, the economy started to decline drastically. During the period between 1975 and 1990 Zambia's economy dropped by approximately 30%.<ref name=""EconomyDrop"">{{cite web

To deal with the crisis, Zambia took big loans from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Worldbank]] hoping that copper prices would rise again soon, instead of issuing structural reforms.

===Foreign policy===
Internationally, Zambia's sympathies lay with forces opposing colonial or white-dominated rule. During the next decade, it actively [[Zambia and Regional Diplomacy|supported movements]] such as the National Unions for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) under the independence war and under the subsequent [[Angolan civil war|civil war]], the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) in [[Southern Rhodesia]], and the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in their struggle against [[apartheid]] in [[South African Republic|the Republic of South Africa]], and the South-West Africa People's Organization ([[SWAPO]]) in their struggle for independence for [[Namibia]]. Zambia also hosted some of the movements. For instance, the ANC exile headquarters were in Lusaka, and ZAPU had a military base in Zambia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Macmillan|first=Hugh|date=2009|title=The African National Congress of South Africa in Zambia: The Culture of Exile and the Changing Relationship with Home, 1964-1990|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|volume=35|issue=2|pages=303–329|doi=10.1080/03057070902919876|jstor=40283235|s2cid=144264448|issn=0305-7070}}</ref> This resulted in security problems, as the South Africa and South Rhodesia raided targets inside Zambia on several occasions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia (01/09)|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2359.htm|last=Department Of State.

In retaliation for the shooting down of Flight 825 in September 1978, the [[Rhodesian Air Force]] attacked the ZIPRA guerrilla base at Westlands farm near Lusaka in October 1978, warning Zambian forces by radio not to interfere.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rhodesian War: A Military History |last1=Moorcraft |first1=Paul L. |author-link1=Paul Moorcraft |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Peter |author-link2=Peter McLaughlin |date=2008 |orig-year=1982 |location=Barnsley |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] |isbn=978-1-84415-694-8 |pages=140–143}}</ref>

Conflicts with Rhodesia resulted in the closing of Zambia's borders with that country and severe problems with international transport and power supply. However, the [[Kariba Dam|Kariba]] [[hydroelectric]] station on the [[Zambezi River]] provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the country's requirements for electricity. [[TAZARA]], a railway to the Tanzanian port of [[Dar es Salaam]], built with Chinese assistance, reduced Zambian dependence on the railway line south to South Africa and west through an increasingly war-ravaged Angola.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Republic of Zambia|url=https://www.szi.gov.zm/epamodzi/?page_id=4561|website=Republic of Zambia e-Pamodzi portal|access-date=2020-05-27|archive-date=2019-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513104943/http://www.szi.gov.zm/epamodzi/?page_id=4561|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Civil strife in neighbouring [[Mozambique]] and Angola created large numbers of refugees, many of whom fled to Zambia.

Internationally, Zambia was an active member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM), and hosted a summit in Lusaka in 1970. Kenneth Kaunda served as the movements chairman 1970–1973. Among the NAM countries Zambia was especially close to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Outside the NAM Zambia also had close relations with the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=RESOLUTIONSOF THETHIRD CONFERENCE OF NON-ALIGNED STATES With Selected Conference Statements and Comments|url=https://media.africaportal.org/documents/SAIIA_RESOLUTIONS_OF_THE_THIRD_CONFERENCE_OF_NON-ALIGNED_STATES.pdf|date=1970|website=Africaportal.org|access-date=2020-05-29|archive-date=2022-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401121552/https://media.africaportal.org/documents/SAIIA_RESOLUTIONS_OF_THE_THIRD_CONFERENCE_OF_NON-ALIGNED_STATES.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Multi-party democracy==
===End of one-party rule===

One party rule and the declining economy created disappointment among the people. Several [[strike action|strikes]] hit the country in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CRISES OF EXPECTATIONS: WORKERS' STRUGGLES IN ZAMBIA, 1964-2011|url=http://dspace.unza.zm/bitstream/handle/123456789/6035/PHD%20THESIS%20F.E%20MULENGA%20041217.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|last=MULENGA|first=FRIDAY ELIYA|date=2017|website=unza.zm}}</ref> The government responded by arresting several [[trade union|union]] leaders, among them [[Frederick Chiluba]]. In 1986 and 1987, protests arose again in [[Lusaka]] and the [[Copperbelt]]. These were followed by riots over rising [[food prices]] in 1990, in which at least 30 people were killed. The same year, the state owned radio claimed that Kaunda had been removed from office by the [[Military of Zambia|army]]. This was not true, and the [[1990 Zambian coup d'état attempt]] failed.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Perlez |first1=Jane  |date=1990-07-01 |title=Failed Zambia Coup Weakens Leader |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/world/failed-zambia-coup-weakens-leader.html |access-date=2022-05-26 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

These extensive protests made Kaunda realise the need for [[reform movement|reform]]. He promised a [[referendum]] on [[multiparty democracy]], and lifted the ban on political parties. This resulted in the quick formation of eleven new parties. Among these [[Movement for Multiparty Democracy]] (MMD), led by former union leader Frederick Chiluba, was the most important. After pressure for the new parties the referendum was canceled in favour of direct multiparty election.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-07-09 |title=Kenneth Kaunda: The dove which triumphed over hawks and vultures, By Owei Lakemfa |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/472583-kenneth-kaunda-the-dove-which-triumphed-over-hawks-and-vultures-by-owei-lakemfa.html |access-date=2022-05-26 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Frederick Chiluba and the MMD===
After a new [[constitution]] had been drafted, [[Zambian general election, 1991|elections]] were held in 1991. They were generally regarded to have been free and fair, and Chiluba won 76% of the presidential vote, and the MMD 125 of the 150 seats in the [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]], with UNIP taking the remaining 25.<ref name=""elections""/>

Economically, Chiluba, despite being a former union leader, stood to the right of Kaunda. With support from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]], to which Zambia was heavily indebted, he liberalised the economy by restricting government interference, re-privatising state-owned enterprises, such as the important copper mining industry, and removing subsidies on various commodities, most notably on [[corn meal]].

When one party rule was first abolished in 1991, many expected a more democratic future for Zambia. These expectations were, however, clouded by the MMD's treatment of the opposition. Questionable amendments of the constitution and detentions of political opponents caused major criticism, and some donor countries, i.e., the United Kingdom and Denmark, withdrew their [[aid]].

====Coups and emergencies====
In 1993, the government-owned newspaper, ''[[The Times of Zambia]],'' reported a story about a secret UNIP plan to take control of government by unconstitutional means, called the ""Zero Option Plan"". The plan included industrial unrest, promotion of violence and organisations of mass protests. UNIP did not deny the existence of such a plan, but underlined that it was not a part of their official policy, but the views of extremists within the party. The government responded by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and putting 26 people into detention. Of these, seven, including Kenneth Kaunda's son [[Wezi Kaunda]] were charged with offences against the security of the state. The rest were released.<ref name=""HRW"">{{cite web

Prior to the [[Zambian general election, 1996|1996 elections]], UNIP formed an alliance with six other opposition parties. Kenneth Kaunda had earlier retired from politics, but after internal turbulence in the party due to the ""Zero Option Plan"" scandal, he returned, replacing his own successor [[Kebby Musokotwane]]. Chiluba's government then amended the constitution, banning people whose parents were not both Zambian citizens from becoming president. This was directly aimed at Kaunda, whose parents were both from [[Malawi]]. In protest UNIP and its allies boycotted the elections, which were then easily won by Chiluba and the MMD.

In 1997, matters escalated. On 28 October a [[1997 Zambian coup d'état attempt|coup d'état attempt]] took place, as a group of army commanders took control over the national radio station, broadcasting a message stating that Chiluba was no longer president. The coup was brought to an end by regular forces, after Chiluba had again declared a state of emergency. One person was killed during the operation. After the failed coup, the police arrested at least 84 people accused of involvement.<ref name=""BBC1"">{{cite web

'''''A history of Zambia''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Andrew D. Roberts]], first published in 1976 by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]].

==Synopsis and structure==
Andrew Roberts’ ''A History of Zambia'' is recognized by scholars as a clear, well-structured, and balanced account of Zambia’s history. Reviewers note the book for its strong emphasis on the precolonial and early colonial periods.Roberts begins with an overview of Zambia’s physical geography and early human history, including the Stone Age and Iron Age. He explains how different cultural traditions developed across regions and how societies organized politically, economically, and socially. The book traces the rise of chieftainship and the growth of trade networks before colonial rule, with attention to key regions such as the Lozi kingdom and Kazembe’s domain. It then examines the effects of African migrations, such as the arrival of the Ngoni and Kololo, and the expansion of long-distance trade.<ref name=""Gann-ZambianPast"">{{cite journal |last=Gann |first=L. H. |date=1977 |title=The Zambian Past: Review of ''A History of Zambia'', by A.

Roberts details the gradual British occupation in the late 19th century and continues through the colonial period, highlighting the growth of mining, labor migration, and the emergence of nationalist movements. He ends with Zambia’s transition to independence in 1964 and its first decade as a sovereign nation. Reviewers note the book’s use of archaeology and oral tradition, as well as its readable style and features like maps and a structured bibliography. While some suggest the later chapters are more concise, they agree the book offers a valuable and accessible introduction to Zambia’s past, suitable for both scholars and general readers.<ref name=""Schecter-Zambia"">{{cite journal |last=Schecter |first=R.

The '''1985 Kabwe Conference''', formally known as the '''Second National Consultative Conference of the African National Congress (ANC)''', was the conference of the [[African National Congress| ANC]] held in [[Kabwe]], [[Zambia]], from 16 to 23 June 1985. This gathering marked the first time in decades that the [[National Executive Committee of the African National Congress]] (NEC) was fully elected and transformed into a fully non-racial body.

The Kabwe conference also elected [[Nelson Mandela]] as deputy president in absentia while incarcerated on [[Robben Island]] as part of maitenaning his symbol. Mandela's written message was read out at the conference and it emphasized his call for unity within the ANC and the broader liberation movement, highlighting that despite physical separation and communication challenges the ANC must emerge stronger and more united - praising ANC President [[Oliver Tambo]] and [[South African Communist Party| South African communist]] leader [[Joe Slovo]].<ref>[http://www.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/za-online/on-this-day/1099-message-to-the-second-national-consultative-conference-of-the-anc-kabwe-zambia-25-june-1985 Nelson Mandela Foundation: Message to the Second National Consultative Conference of the ANC, Kabwe, 25 June 1985], Nelson Mandela Foundation, retrieved 13 August 2025</ref>

== Overview ==
The conference followed the [[Morogoro Conference]] of 1969. It was attended by 250 delegates and special invitees from ANC branches, units and student organizations, mainly exiled South African activists from [[Tanzania]], [[Angola]], and Zambia and chaired by Dan Tloome. [[Oliver Tambo]] as president delivered the opening address, emphasizing the ongoing violence and repression by the apartheid regime in South Africa, including a recent raid in [[Botswana]] by apartheid police and which killed fifteen people, some of whom were ANC members. His speech took several hours to deliver. The conference received various international messages of solidarity from among others [[Abdou Diouf]], [[Organisation of African Unity]], [[German Democratic Republic]], [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], [[USSR]], [[British Labour Party]], [[United Nations]], [[Romanian Communist Party]], [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], [[China]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Australia]], [[American Committee on Africa]], [[Cuba]], [[Italy]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[India]] and it reaffirmed the ANC's commitment to intensify the struggle against apartheid while addressing financial and organisational challenges facing the movement in exile.<ref>[https://omalley.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/site/q/03lv03445/04lv04015/05lv04016/06lv04025/07lv04027.htm Report of the 2nd Consultative Conference of the ANC - 1985], Nelson Mandela Foundation, retrieved 13 August 2025</ref><ref>[https://www.anc1912.org.za/national-consultative-conference_1985/ National Consultative Conference 1985 – ANC], ANC archival site.

Among the key resolutions, the conference adopted new internal judicial and accountability mechanisms to strengthen discipline and justice within the ANC. These included the adoption of a Code of Conduct, the establishment of the Office of Justice, and the creation of the National People’s Tribunal, an independent body mandated to oversee investigations and adjudicate internal offences and grievances. The National People’s Tribunal was chaired by [[Hermanus Loots]], with lawyers [[Shadrack Pekane]] and [[Z.N. Jobodwana]] as members. It followed procedures similar to South African courts, ensuring accused members had the right to legal representation and fair hearings. The Tribunal could recommend various outcomes, including release, expulsion from the movement, imprisonment at the ANC Rehabilitation Centre, or, in capital cases, the death sentence. All decisions were subject to review by a Review Board and confirmation by the ANC President [[Oliver Tambo]].These measures marked an important step in professionalising internal governance and ensuring accountability.<ref>[https://omalley.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/site/q/03lv02167/04lv02264/05lv02303/06lv02304/07lv02315.htm Further submissions made by the ANC to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission], O'Malley Archives.

The heavily guarded conference held near the army base [[Kohima Barracks]], with Zambian troops on alert against possible South African commando attacks, the conference urged both the armed seizure of power and a negotiated settlement. Though these seemed contradictory, the ANC viewed them as complementary strategies to end apartheid. Though the conference did not resolve the practicalities of seizing power in South Africa, Tambo’s stirring words convinced members that white rule could be defeated, revitalising the ANC’s drive and political momentum. Internationally, the ANC gained renewed recognition as a potential alternative government. Speaking on ''[[Radio Freedom]]'' afterwards, Tambo declared that the struggle for a united, democratic, non-racial South Africa was irreversible, urging “mobilisation, organisation and struggle.”<ref>[https://ourconstitution.wethepeoplesa.org/south-african-constitution/negotiating-our-freedom/the-kabwe-conference/ The story of Kabwe that followed], We The People, retrieved 13 August 2025</ref>

== Criticisms and controversies ==

The 1985 Kabwe Conference, while significant in revitalizing the ANC during exile, faced sharp criticism from some members and observers for its undemocratic practices and internal repression. Critics argued that the conference was dominated by the ANC's security apparatus, known as Mbokodo, which was accused of operating above the law and suppressing dissent harshly within the movement.<ref name=""auto"">[https://searchlightsouthafrica.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Searchlight-South-Africa-No-5-Jan-1991.pdf The ANC Conference: From Kabwe to Johannesburg (pdf)], Searchlight South Africa, Vol 2, No.2, January 1991. Retrieved 13 August 2025.</ref> Concerns were raised that the conference lacked genuine democratic processes, with more appointed officials than elected delegates, many of whom allegedly had no mandate to vote. It was noted that some security personnel and staff voted alongside official delegates, blurring lines between civil servants and representatives. The conference reportedly avoided discussion of key issues, such as divisions within [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), and failed to address a mutiny that had occurred in 1984 within the ANC's armed wing. Investigations into this mutiny and alleged abuses by the security department were not tabled at the conference. Ethnic tensions within the ANC were also highlighted, with accusations of favoritism towards Xhosa members in leadership positions, contributing to a perception of tribalism. Corruption and moral misconduct within the ANC leadership, including misuse of power for personal gain and exploitation, were other serious concerns expressed by critics. These criticisms reflect ongoing debates about the ANC's internal governance during its years in exile, illustrating tensions between the leadership and ordinary members.<ref name=""auto""/>

'''Kazembe''' is a traditional kingdom in modern-day [[Zambia]], and southeastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. For more than 250 years, Kazembe has been an influential kingdom of the [[Luba-Katanga language|Kiluba]]-[[Bemba language|Chibemba]], speaking the language of the Eastern [[Luba people|Luba]]-[[Lunda people|Lunda]] people of south-central Africa<ref name=""Gordon"">{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0021853705001283|author=David M. Gordon|title=History on the Luapula Retold: Landscape, Memory and Identity in the Kazembe Kingdom|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=47|pages=21|year=2006}}</ref> (also known as the Luba, Luunda, Eastern Luba-Lunda, and Luba-Lunda-Kazembe). Its position on trade routes in a well-watered, relatively fertile and well-populated area of forestry, fishery and agricultural resources<ref name=""Gordon""/> drew expeditions by traders and explorers (such as Scottish missionary [[David Livingstone]]<ref name=""Livingstone"">[[David Livingstone]] and [[Horace Waller (activist)|Horace Waller]] (ed.) (1874) ''The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death''. Two volumes, John Murray.</ref>) who called it variously Kasembe, Cazembe and Casembe.

Known by the title Mwata Yav now equivalent to 'Paramount Chief'or King, the monarchy with its annual [[Mtomboko ceremony|Mutomboko festival]] stands out in the [[Luapula]] Valley and [[Lake Mweru]] in present-day [[Zambia]], though its history in colonial times is an example of how Europeans divided traditional kingdoms and tribes without regard to the consequences.

Around 1740 the first Mwata, Ng'anga Bilonda of the [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba]]-[[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda Kingdom]] headed by [[Mwata Yamvo]] (or 'Mwaant Yav') 300&nbsp;km west of the Luapula in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], left with a group of followers in pursuit eastwards of one Mutanda who had murdered his father Chinyanta and uncle by drowning them in the Mukelweji River.<ref name=""Gordon""/> 'Mwata' was originally a title equivalent to 'General', the first of the Mwata Kazembe line were warriors.<ref name=""Livingstone""/>

After Mutanda had been dealt with, the group continued the eastward migration under Mwata Kazembe II Kanyembo Mpemba, crossing the Luapula River at Matanda, conquering the indigenous people known as the Shila in the Luapula Valley, and setting up Luba or Lunda aristocrats as chiefs over them.<ref name=""chiefsofzambia"">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626071851/http://www.chiefsofzambia.homestead.com/mutomboko.html THE MUTOMBOKO CEREMONY]. Chiefs of Zambia.</ref> Though bringing Lunda and [[Luba people|Luba]] customs and culture (such as the Luba style of ceremonial chieftainship), they adopted the language of the [[Luba-Bemba people|Bemba]], a tribe that had also migrated from the Congo and to which they were allied.<ref name=""Gordon""/>

The kingdom prospered from the fisheries of [[Lake Mweru]] and the [[Mofwe Lagoon]], and natural resources, including copper ore in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], west of the Luapula.<ref name=""Gordonc"">David Gordon (2000) “Decentralized Despots or Contingent Chiefs: Comparing Colonial Chiefs in Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo.” KwaZulu-Natal History and African Studies Seminar, University of Natal, Durban.</ref> Mwata Kazembe was said by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] to be able to raise a force of 20,000 men, and his lands stretched west to the [[Lualaba River]] (the border with Mwata Yamvo's western Luba-Lunda kingdom and with the other Luba's kingdoms north of that) and east to the [[Luba-Bemba people|Luba-Bemba]] country.<ref name=""Livingstone""/> (See the map below.)

In addition to trading with the interior, the Portuguese hoped to establish a route through it connecting their territories of [[Angola]] in the west and [[Mozambique]] in the east.<ref name=""Gordonb"">{{cite journal|author=David M.

[[Image:Kazembe Kingdom 433x455.JPG|right|thumb|The Kazembe kingdom in its prime in the first half of the 19th Century.]]

The expeditions were:<ref name=""EB"">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cazembe}}</ref>
* 1796 Manuel Caetano Pereira, a [[merchant]].
* 1798 [[Francisco de Lacerda|Francisco José de Lacerda e Almeida]] who came via Tete and died within a few weeks of arriving at Kazembe's, still waiting for trade negotiations to start. He left a valuable journal which was carried back to [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] by his chaplain, Father Pinto, and which was later translated into English by the explorer [[Sir Richard Burton]].
* 1802 Pedro João Baptista and Amaro José, ''[[pombeiros]]'' (slave traders).
* 1831 Major José Monteiro and António Gamito, with 20 [[soldiers]] and 120 slaves as [[Porter (carrier)|porters]], sent from [[Vila de Sena|Sena]] by the Portuguese governor of that district. Gamito also wrote a journal and said, ""We certainly never expected to find so much ceremonial, pomp, and ostentation in the potentate of a region so remote from the sea coast.""<ref name=""Simbao""/>

As trade missions, though, they were all failures. Mwata Kazembe III Lukwesa Ilunga and IV Kanyembo Keleka Mayi rebuffed Portuguese attempts to set up the alliance which would control the [[Atlantic]]-Indian Ocean trade route from beginning to end.<ref name=""EB""/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Ian Cunnison|title=Kazembe and the Portuguese 1798–1832|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=2|pages=61|doi=10.1017/S0021853700002140 |year=2009}}</ref> (The [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] and [[Msiri]] later took control of that route, with Msiri rather than Kazembe as the [[linchpin]].)

====David Livingstone's visit====
In 1867 the explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] embarked on his last expedition in Africa, one aim of which was to discover the southern extent of the [[Nile]] basin (i.e. resolving whether [[Lake Victoria]] truly was the source of the Nile or whether some other lake further south was the source). From 'Nyasaland' ([[Malawi]]) and past the southern tip of [[Lake Tanganyika]], through country ravaged by the slave trade, he reached the northeastern shore of Lake Mweru. He continued south down the eastern shore. Mwata Kazembe VII had been alerted to his arrival and received him at his capital which was then at [[Kanyembo]] near the northeast tip of the Mofwe Lagoon:<ref name=""Livingstone""/>
<blockquote>
“The court or compound of Casembe—some would call it a palace—is a square enclosure of 300 yards by 200 yards. It is surrounded by a hedge of high reeds. Inside, where Casembe honoured me with a grand reception, stands a gigantic hut for Casembe, and a score of small huts for domestics. The Queen's hut stands behind that of the chief, with a number of small huts also ...  Kasembe sat before his hut on an equate seat placed on lion and leopard skins. He was clothed in a coarse blue and white Manchester print edged with red baize, and arranged in large folds so as to look like a crinoline put on wrong side foremost. His arms, legs and head were covered with sleeves, leggings and cap made of various coloured beads in neat patterns: a crown of yellow feathers surmounted his cap ...  He then assured me that I was welcome to his country, to go where I liked, and do what I chose. We then went (two boys carrying his train behind him) to an inner apartment, where the articles of my present were exhibited in detail

Livingstone noted that Mwata Kazembe VII's administration was harsh: A common punishment for court officials was to have the ears cropped by shears. Owing to such tyranny, he would have difficulty raising a thousand men. He observed that the kingdom was not now as prosperous as the Portuguese had reported. The next year he again visited Mwata, who was the first to tell him that the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]], [[Lake Bangweulu]], the Luapula, Lake Mweru and the [[Luvua River|Luvua]]-[[Lualaba River|Lualaba]] were all one system. This sent Livingstone exploring Bangweulu, then the Lualaba which he thought may flow into the Nile, and Tanganyika, then back to Bangweulu and his death five years later, still trying to discover how its rivers link up and for any evidence that it was part of the Nile rather than the [[Congo Basin]].<ref name=""Livingstone""/>

In the 18th and 19th centuries Arab and Swahili traders visited Mwata Kazembe to trade in copper, ivory and slaves. Trade routes such as that from [[Zanzibar]] via [[Ujiji]] on [[Lake Tanganyika]] were well established, and the Sultan of Zanzibar's name carried weight. Livingstone was held up southeast of Lake Tanganyika by a conflict between [[Tippu Tip]] (Ahmed bin Mohamed, whom Livingstone called Tipo Tipo) and a local chief. When he reached Mwata Kazembe's he found a trader named Mohamad Bogharib had arrived a few days before seeking ivory, and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as Mpamari), a trader who had been there for ten years, as Mwata had refused to let him leave. Despite their involvement in the slave trade, Livingstone travelled with and was helped by them; he claimed to have used his influence to get Mohamed bin Saleh released.<ref name=""Livingstone""/>

In 1856, [[Msiri]] travelled through Kazembe with a band of followers and requested permission from King Chinyanta Munona to settle among Kazembe's tributary of [[Garanganze|Garanganza]] (Katanga). Throughout the 1860s, Kazembe's copper and [[ivory trade]] was usurped by Msiri,<ref name=""Gordon""/> growing his power with the help of local traders and their descendents, known as ''bayeke.'' With the help of the ''bayeke,'' Msiri rebelled against the chief of Garanganza and established the [[Yeke Kingdom]]. Utilizing gunpowder weapons, Msiri rapidly expanded through former Kazembe territory, carving a large territory for himself and reducing the Kazembe to a small state along [[Lake Bangweulu|Lake Bangwelu]], which he held sway over until his death in 1890.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Reefe |first=Thomas |title=The Rainbow and the Kings |year=1981 |isbn=9780520334908}}</ref>

===Colonial history===

====Division between British and Belgian territories====
After Msiri's death, the Luapula valley was divided in 1894 between Britain – the eastern shores of the Luapula and Lake Mweru became part of [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]], administered by the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) – and King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s misnamed [[Congo Free State]] (CFS), or rather its agent, the Compagnie du Katanga, which took over the western shores. The Belgian colonial authorities, having killed Msiri were left with a vacuum. They appointed chiefs – not ones chosen from Msiri's subordinate chiefs (who had previously been subordinate to Mwata Kazembe) – but from what the Luba-Lunda called the 'owners of the land' who had preceded them;<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ian Cunnison|title=The Luapula Peoples of Northern Rhodesia: Custom and History in Tribal Politics|journal=Science|volume=133|issue=3455|pages=751|doi=10.1126/science.133.3455.751-a |year=1961}}</ref> there was considerable instability in that part of Katanga as a result. “Belgian administration in Mweru-Luapula was glossed over by a thin veneer of traditional justifications.”<ref name=""Gordonc""/> This included ‘creating’ a tribe from what was a clan, the Bena Ngoma.

Once Belgian colonial rule was established west of the Luapula, Mwata Kazembe's rule and territory, though not his influence, was confined to the eastern side.

====British rule imposed by force====
Although Mwata Kazembe X had signed a BSAC mineral concession and a British treaty brought to him by [[Alfred Sharpe]] in 1890, and allowed visits by British missionary pioneer [[Dan Crawford (missionary)|Dan Crawford]], when the BSAC tax collector [[Blair Watson]] took up residence on the [[Kalungwishi River]] in 1897, Mwata Kazembe refused to let the British flag be flown over his territory or taxes to be collected from his people, and he defeated an armed incursion by Watson's forces.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

Sharpe by now was governor of the [[British Central Africa Protectorate]] ([[Nyasaland]]), 1000&nbsp;km away. It was he who had failed to secure Msiri's [[Garanganze|Garanganza]] kingdom as a British [[Protectorate]] by negotiation, and had later seen it taken from under British noses by the rival CFS through force. In 1899, in conjunction with [[Robert Edward Codrington|Robert Codrington]], acting BSAC Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia, Sharpe sent British officers with [[Sikh]] and Nyasaland troops who burnt Mwata Kazembe's capital to the ground, killing a number of his people, though Mwata himself had already escaped across the Luapula.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

Mwata Kazembe X made his way south and crossed back over the river to take refuge in the [[Mambilima Falls|Johnston Falls Mission]] run by a Mr and Mrs Anderson of [[Dan Crawford (missionary)|Dan Crawford]]'s missionary society. (Ironically, two years before, Mwata Kazembe X had tried to have the Andersons' predecessor at Mambilima, H. J. Pomeroy, killed, but failed.<ref name=""nrzam.org.uk"">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V1N3/V1N3.htm |journal=[[Northern Rhodesia Journal]] |author= William Lammond|title=Fifty Years in Central Africa|volume=1|issue= 3|pages=3–7 |year=1951}}</ref><ref name=""DACBL"">J.

Dan Crawford and Alfred Sharpe had been involved in a similar situation in 1890–91 with [[Msiri]] (see that article). At that time Crawford's superior, Charles Swan, had encouraged Msiri to resist Sharpe's British treaty. A year later Msiri was killed by the Belgians, and the region was plunged into chaos. Now, the Andersons responded to Swan differently. While Mr Anderson kept Mwata Kazembe's men at Mambilima, Mrs Anderson took Mwata Kazembe alone to the British officers back at his burnt capital, saying ""please be kind to him"".<ref name=""nrzam.org.uk""/> Disarmed by this approach and the Mwata's agreement to accept their rule, the British agreed to let him come back.

Mwata Kazembe X rebuilt his capital at [[Kazembe (Mwansabombwe)|Mwansabombwe]]. The British troops took a number of old and valuable works of art of [[Luba people|Luba]] origin from the court, which they gave to Codrington{{Citation Needed|date=August 2022}}. In 1920 his heirs placed them in the National Museum of [[Southern Rhodesia]] in [[Bulawayo]], 1000&nbsp;km away, where they were listed as the 'Codrington Collection'.<ref name=""NRJV3N6"">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/Site%20Resources/NRJ/V3N1/044.jpg |journal=Northern Rhodesia Journal|title=Robert Edward Codrington 1869–1908|volume= 3 |issue=6|year=1956}}</ref><ref>Neville Jones (1930s).

After the [[punitive expedition]], Mwata Kazembe X and his successors worked with the BSAC and its successors, the British District Commissioners, and to some extent it rescued his chieftainship. The Mwata Kazembes had some influence in the colonial era because the British colonial administration ruled indirectly through chiefs.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

====The coming of missionaries====
With Dan Crawford's influence Mwata Kazembe X readily agreed to requests to establish missions in the valley, especially from the [[Plymouth Brethren|Christian Missions in Many Lands]] and the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) which had sent Livingstone to Africa. In 1900 the LMS [[Mbereshi]] Mission was established 10&nbsp;km from Mwansabombwe.<ref name=""Chuba"">Bwalya S Chuba (2000) ''Mbeleshi in a history of the London Missionary Society'', Pula Press.</ref> Here schools, a church and a hospital were established, and brick makers and builders were trained, resulting in the Luapula valley enjoying a higher standard of sun-dried and burnt brick house construction than elsewhere in the region. Other Protestant and Catholic missions established schools and hospitals in the Luapula Valley and on the lake.<ref name=""Chuba""/>

Though by the mid-20th century Mwata Kazembe's realm had become overshadowed by the copper mines and industry of Elisabethville ([[Lubumbashi]]) and the [[Copperbelt]], through their education gained mostly in mission schools, many Luba-Lunda-Kazembe people made their mark in those towns and in [[Lusaka]], and their experience and influence there flowed back the other way.<ref name=""Chuba""/>

Following the [[Luba Empire|Luba]] kingdom model, Mwata Kazembe as the king has senior chiefs under him, and subordinate chiefs and village headmen under them. The Senior Chiefs are Lukwesa, Kashiba, Kambwali and Kanyembo. Mwata appoints these chiefs from his family and, upon his death, one of these senior chiefs may be promoted to the paramount position. There are also chiefs in neighbouring districts who pay tribute to Mwata Kazembe.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

Also following Luba custom, Mwata Kazembe ruled through a council which in colonial times became a 'Superior Native Authority', named in this case the Lunda Native Authority (LNA) to which he appointed a 'cabinet' of advisers who meet under his chairmanship. The LNA was the largest and dominant native authority in the Luapula-Mweru valley. Its work had to be reported to the British District Commissioners who preferred to base themselves in the climate and environment of Kawambwa on the plateau rather than in the heat and mosquitoes of the valley where most of the population lived. It took up a whole day just for quick visit and, in the absence of problems, this allowed the Kazembe chieftainship considerable autonomy.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

====Functions of the kingdom====
Essentially the functions of the kingdom are in the realm of local government, with a stronger emphasis on cultural, social and historical aspects of the life of Kazembe people wherever they may live. The Mwata and his council make regulations in areas not covered by national law or provincial regulations, of land and resource use and management, buildings and infrastructure, employment and occupations, trade and markets, hygiene and health, and traditions and customs including traditional marriage and family life. The Mwata has messengers and guards to enforce regulations, and operates a traditional court to try transgressors; he is also involved in the resolution of disputes.

The Belgian Congo copper-mining town of [[Lubumbashi|Elisabethville]] developed faster than the Northern Rhodesian [[Copperbelt]]. Cut off by the [[Congo Pedicle]], the [[Luapula Province]] was regarded as a backwater by the Northern Rhodesian government in the first part of the 20th century, so that at first Elisabethville was the most accessible city for the Kazembe, connected as it was by road to the Congolese port of [[Kasenga]] on the Luapula, and by boat from there up the river to Lake Mweru. There was migration from the British-administered side to the Belgian one.<ref name=""Gordonc""/> For further details, see the articles on the [[Congo Pedicle]] and [[Congo Pedicle road]].

Mwata Kazembe XIV Shadreck Chinyanta Nankula in the 1940s did much to change this situation. He developed the kingdom and the district, and has been called the first ""modernizing"" Mwata.<ref name=""Gordonb""/> He had been educated and employed in Elizabethville and spoke fluent French and English. He galvanised the LNA, changing its name to the Lunda National Association, and appointing to it people with an energy for change and development, like himself. The District Commissioner worried that some of these, such as [[Dauti Yamba]] were nationalists who might stir up trouble against the colonial administration, but relationships remained workable.<ref name=""Gordonc""/> Mwata Kazembe XIV encouraged the building of schools and clinics in Mwansabombwe and the expansion of missions such as Mbereshi. He wrote an account of the chieftainship which was edited by a White Father missionary, Edouard Labreque,<ref name=""Chuba""/> and finally published in Chibemba as ''Ifikolwe Fyandi na Bantu Bandi'' (My Ancestors and My People)<ref name=""Gordon""/> built the current two-storey Mwata's residence but died two days before it was complete.<ref name=""chiefsofzambia""/>

In the early 1950s, some problems were created across the Luapula when the Luba-Lunda there noted that Mwata Kazembe's courts dispensed justice more to their liking than the Belgians and their chiefs, and asked to be tried for transgressions by the Mwata's courts on the grounds that as Lunda, they had that right, and the local chiefs did not have the authority. But this was not granted.<ref name=""Gordonc""/>

The modernising of the kingdom was matched by an increase in prosperity as the Pedicle road connected the Luapula Province to the Copperbelt, and fish and labour flowed more easily to that market.

In 1964 Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia. For a time, chiefs saw their influence overshadowed by party politics and the civil administrations, though in 1985 Mwata Kazembe XVIII was appointed District Commissioner in [[Kawambwa]] and later, Provincial Political Secretary.<ref name=""Cancel"">{{cite journal|author=Robert Cancel|title=Asserting/inventing traditions on the Luapula: the Mutomboko Festival|journal=African Arts|volume=39|issue=3|pages=12|doi=10.1162/afar.2006.39.3.12 |year=2006}}</ref>

The fish and labour economic booms in the forties, fifties and sixties gave way to recessions and stagnation from the mid-seventies onwards as fish catches declined, Copperbelt employment contracted and national problems had an effect. However, the construction in the late sixties of the 'Zambia Way', a road connecting [[Mansa, Zambia|Mansa]] to [[Nchelenge]]-[[Kashikishi]] through Mwansabombwe, and its surfacing and linking to Kawambwa, [[Samfya]] and [[Serenje]] over the next two decades, has funnelled trade through Mwansabombwe, the population of which has risen to around 50,000.<ref name=""Cancel""/>

The Mwata Kazembe chieftainship has endured and though originating in war and being surrounded by countries that have experienced much conflict, it has presided over peace on the eastern shores of the Luapula and Lake Mweru for more than a century.

This article deals with the disputed area on the borders of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]], in [[Luapula Province]].

==Origins in the 1894 treaty==

[[Zambia]]'s formal northern frontier boundary was legally signed in the Anglo-Belgian Treaty of 1894, long after the 1884 [[Berlin Conference]]. This showed that the triangle of land at the northwestern point of Eastern Rhodesia from [[Pweto]] to as far south as the Lunchinda River was under Northern Rhodesia even though the [[Belgian Congo]] had administered it for many years. Belgians administered it as a matter of local convenience under a gentleman’s agreement. Much of this administration was facilitated by the Belgium missionary work in education and health, particularly the Roman Catholic Church and Greek fishermen who wanted more fishing points to supply the reported increase in demand for fish in the emerging mine town of Elizabethville (now [[Lubumbashi]]). Later, the Belgians wanted to claim this land. Over the years, during British colonial rule, District Commissioners and Provincial Commissioners were asked to provide information on the affected areas by central government authorities in [[Lusaka]].

The real border issue for the Northern Frontier was reported to be on [[Lake Tanganyika]]'s Cape Akalunga, mentioned in the treaty and described as the point of reference. In reality, officials had found it difficult to locate this cape. British maps show the boundary meeting at Cape Pungu (Chitankwa) whilst Belgian maps of 1955 show the meeting point at Cape Kipimbi which is far south of Cape Pungu, thereby cutting deep into assumed [[Northern Rhodesia]]n territory.

During the time of the [[Central African Federation]], the Northern-Rhodesian Federal government’s Assistant Secretary Fraser, believed that there may be mineral deposits in Pweto area and therefore all the more need for the Federal Government to protect sovereignty. Weedens Minerals & Chartered Exploration held prospecting rights in that area. These have never been challenged. There is documentation that in 1936, Belgians had asked for 180 acres (730,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) of Northern Rhodesian land apparently where Belgian colonial residences were built. However, no evidence exists that Britain conceded to this request. In 1957, A V Ellison, an official in the Ministry of Lands & Local Government reported to the Federal government of Northern Rhodesia that triangulation surveys had been made by the Anglo-Belgian Boundary Commission from 1911–1913, when eventually a de facto boundary for the northern frontier was agreed upon. That boundary clearly indicates that Pweto was the northwestern point of reference for the northern frontier.

==Belgian interests==

In 1931 another British/Belgian Boundary Commission was set up. A Peake/Gendarme agreement was proposed. It was suggested that a meandering line following the watershed and [[thalweg]]s of the streams replace the straight line between Lake Mweru and Lake Tanganyika. This exchange was to favour Northern Rhodesia but was consequently rejected by the Belgians. In July 1958 Thomson, District Commissioner who visited Chief Puta’s area, noted an influx of the populace from the area occupied by Belgians into Northern Rhodesia. They were running away from compulsory agricultural measures in Pweto’s area. The fact is that these were not refugees in the sense the term is used today. They were resisting the brutal Belgium occupation, under which they had been left without British protection. Distance and cost was the simplest excuse that British authorities in Northern Rhodesia could offer for not protecting them. After all, apart from the mining companies, the British definition of its interests in Northern Rhodesia were at best ambivalent, apart from occupying a piece of real estate.

On 8 August 1958, a preparatory meeting for the Belgian government and the Federal Government of Rhodesia & Nyasaland to discuss the Northern Rhodesia/Congo boundary was convened. Present at the meeting representing Northern Rhodesian interests were:

*A W Osminara – Assistant Secretary and Chair
*W H H Jones – Acting Solicitor General
*T W Fraser – Assistant Secretary (W)
*P W W Allin – Surveyor General
*S G Burlock – Acting Land Commissioner
*M S Wagner – Assistant Secretary (R)
*J C L Durrant – Acting Assistant Secretary (N)
*G Howe – Administrative Officer
*F N N Parry – Federal Government representative
*M S Benoy – 	

Belgium interests in the north appeared to be fishing and hunting in the Lake Mweru region, and possession of Kilwa Island. A joint Mweru-Luapula fisheries agreement was made between Northern Rhodesia and Belgium Congo with regards to:

* Type of nets used
* Fishing rights
* Off-season responsibilities

At this meeting, maps and plans of the areas concerned were discussed. [[Northern Rhodesia]] needed the Pedicle Road that connects Luapula Province to the Copperbelt. (The Pedicle is a wedge of Congolese territory that cuts deep into Zambia to give the country its distinctive butterfly shape.) Belgians were not interested in the road, but were using it as a bargaining tool for other border issues. The Federal Government initially wanted to put a railway through to Luapula as suggested by the Mufulira Copper Mines Ltd. To build a railway, however, meant the land had to be under Federal government control. Parry also saw the advantage of linking the Rhodesian railway system with that of the Congo. At this point in the colonial period, the rights of native inhabitants were considered insignificant and not worthy of consultation.

While the Federal Government wanted control over the pedicle, the Belgians wanted to swop territory in their favour.  The meeting decided to propose the following:

* The Northern Rhodesia government would exchange land on the northwest boundary in the Lubemba area for some of the Mokambo land held by the Belgians. This could have conceded Pweto to Congo.

However, no such swap actually took place in any formal treaty. The Mokambo pedicle remained Belgium Congo territory and yet they still occupied the northern frontier. In effect, a de facto occupation continued without their making any concession.

In the same year, 1958, D F Smith, District Assistant and a team of 11 Africans (2 of whom claimed to know where Cape Akalunga was) visited Mporokoso area to

* Find out the populace
* Find Cape Akalunga

He visited 11 villages.  He met with Chief Mulilo who told him Cape Akalunga was near Chisenga River and had once been called Mutunga village.  It had been under Congolese rule.

==18 November 1958==

Notes on the Northern Frontier, from the Assistant Secretary to the Executive Council.

'''a)''' Belgians concern: Kilwa island, fishing and hunting rights in Lake Mweru area

'''b)''' British concern: Nkana trespass, Mokambo strip.

The Assistant Secretary felt that Northern Rhodesia had bargaining power with the northern frontier (the Mpweto line), which the Belgians were keen on.  He proposed that the Anglo-Belgian Fisheries Advisory Board meet regularly to resolve each territory's fishing rights, to agree on African fishing methods, to agree that the Europeans buy the fish caught by the Africans (Greeks at Mpweto had in the past been doing large scale fishing and refused to buy excess fish from the Africans), to check legislation, and to look into the issue of Belgian Congo's desire to hunt crocodiles. The Assistant Secretary noted that the Belgians were uncooperative.

==22 December 1958==

British Consulate General in [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] wrote to the Federal Government Minister of External Affairs in [[Harare|Salisbury]].  He noted that as the frontier between Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo was situated in Lake Mweru and on the thalweg of the Luapula in a part of its course, it was appropriate for each of the riparian states to exercise their sovereign rights in the waters falling respectively under their jurisdiction.

The maps showed the frontier deviating from the centre of the lake and passing to the west of Kilwa Island which, the Belgians said, was a peninsula attached to Belgian territory.

In the same year, 1958, Mr Bowles visited Brussels and discussed the border issues with M. Grosjean, Inspector General in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No detailed records are available on this meeting, save to note that the frantic efforts between the British and Belgian authorities were taking place precisely at the time when the struggle for independence of the two states, particularly Congo, were getting intense. Congo gained independence in 1960; Northern Rhodesia got it four years later. In 1958 the British settlers were holding on to the territory and were keen to ensure that no land that they claimed to be theirs was surrendered to natives in the Congo.

==20 March 1961==

Staff Sgt G F Tredwell, Provincial Commissioner for Northern province wrote that Cape Akalunga was north of the Libondwe River and a little south of the Chisenga stream.  It was 2 miles in-shore from Lake Tanganyika.  It has a valley where Headman Mutunga had a village many years ago, and it is believed that Chief Moliro had his headquarters there too.  It was under Belgian administration.

==17 April 1961==

Provincial Commissioner E L Button had, in response to a query about the boundary between Lake Mweru and Lake Tanganyika, commented thus: ""Despite the rather nebulous nature of a common boundary, no administrative difficulties had been caused by it, and as such it would be better to let sleeping dogs lie."" Nothing in diplomacy could be as irresponsible as this statement on the question of sovereignty over land, as the case of the submerging [[Kasikili]]/[[Sedudu]] island issue between Namibia and Botswana in recent years shows. In other words, this Briton was now quite happy to concede Zambian territory to the Congo as a matter of convenience when that was not the case when the British or their proxies were ruling the territory.

==29 April 1961==

Acting Administrative Secretary wrote to the Governor of Northern Rhodesia.  He informed the Governor that there were 4 enclaves that were under the Belgian administration, Mpweto- Lunchinda included. The residents were forced to carry Congolese identity cards and been fully subjected to Belgian rule.  Chiefs who were living within the sphere of Belgian control provided tribal control.

==February 1965==

There was a border incident on [[Luapula River]], the details of which were not fully recorded. Since both [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Zambia]] had now gained independence, this incident was between two new republics dealing with an issue left over from the colonial period.

==30 April 1965==

Education Minister [[John Mwanakatwe]] and [[Alex Shapi]] visited Mweru constituency.  They were held at gunpoint and manhandled by the Congolese ([[Katangese]]) gendarmes after crossing the Lunchinda River at Chipungu.  Despite explaining who they were, they were accused of being in Congolese territory.  It was not until the following day that a senior Congolese official who spoke Chibemba saved them and apologised for their mistreatment. They crossed the Lunchinda in the knowledge that they were still in Zambian territory, as the maps showed.  At this time, there was no clinic at Chipungu, so many Zambians sought medical facilities from the Congolese hospital at Mpweto. Even the Belgium Congolese franc was accepted currency in Chipungu area itself, as it was in Pweto. The fact was, Mwanakatwe was legitimately visiting his constituency, as far as the Zambian map showed.

==30 September 1966==

Two English geologists, Dr Premoli and Dr Bratley, and 22 Zambians were to undertake geological investigations on the coast of Lake Tanganyika between Moliro and Nsumbu bay.  They were arrested by the Congolese (Katangese) gendarme and their maps were confiscated. Congo was at war. The Zambian maps showed that this area was Zambian territory.

==November 1966==

In Zambia, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands wrote to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs giving reference to the Mpweto/Lake Tanganyika boundary.  He pointed out that since the border was not clearly established, negotiation was necessary and suggested the setting of a Joint Boundary Commission.

The Surveyor General, D J B Copeland, in a letter dated 18 August 1966, recalled a boundary incident that had occurred in 1961.  Surveyors sent by De Beers Prospecting Ltd had an incident near Mpweto with Congolese officials. The surveyors were accused of being in Congo territory and of illegally prospecting for Congolese gold in Moba territory. This confusion was caused by the following definition of the border.

*Belgian border coordinates	South latitude 8 degrees 18 minutes
*British border coordinates	South latitude 8 degrees 14 minutes

The Police report showed that they had been arrested at the Chisenga River near Chipunelu.

==30 September 1967==
Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Lishomwa Muuka suggested the need for a boundary commission to discuss the dispute over:

* The Congolese claim of 8 degrees 18 minutes south
* The Zambian claim of 8 degrees 15 minutes south

He saw the need to clarify whether the point was Cape Akalunga or Cape Kipimbi.  He wrote to the British High Commissioner for information on the true boundary, but was told there was none available, despite their having been discussions on the [[National boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the boundary in 1927 and 1933 . The British, it appeared had washed their hands of the issue and were not bothered at all if the two countries went to war over a border dispute which they had themselves defended for so many years.

==1968==

The Congolese disputed air space and flying rights over Nippon Mining that had concession rights over Chipushi.

==Summation==
The border issue is a part of the history [[Chienge District]], an area in the northern part of Zambia, on the shores of [[Lake Mweru]].  [[David Livingstone]] visited the Lake Mweru area in 1867 during his search for the source of the [[Zambezi River]]. Following the 1889 [[Berlin conference]] and the ensuing [[Scramble for Africa]] by European powers, there was interest from Belgians, Germans and the British in Southern and Central Africa in securing the area that covered [[Lake Nyasa]], Lake Mweru, [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Victoria]]. In the early 1870s the Germans Reichardt and Bohn, and later in 1878, a larger group of Germans led by Wissman, visited the area around Lake Mweru. The Belgians were already looking at colonising the Congo including the area south of Lake Mweru.

[[Harry H. Johnston]] wrote in a London newspaper introducing the ""[[Cape to Cairo Red Line|Cape to Cairo]]"" concept. He was sent by the Foreign Office to work in Southern Africa, with the [[African Lakes Company]] (ALC), which had its headquarters in [[Blantyre, Nyasaland]] (now [[Malawi]]).  Scottish missionaries who were initially interested in stopping the slave trade by Arabs, and later engaged in trading with the locals had originally set up the Company. Johnston became Commissioner of the African Lakes Company, tasked by the British government with:

* Consolidating the Protectorate of His majesty’s Government over the chiefs
* Advising the local chiefs on their external relations with the locals and foreigners
* Securing peace and order
* Ending the slave trade

The Foreign Office was unable to provide adequate funds for his administering of the area under British rule, and therefore Johnston had to turn to [[Cecil Rhodes]], who was the Chairman of the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC), and struck up a working relationship with him.  He implored Rhodes to support his work by providing financial support.  This Rhodes willingly did in return for Johnston’s representing the interests of the British South Africa Company in the areas that Johnston was to administer.   Rhodes was interested in a future amalgamation with the African Lakes Company, as this would give the BSAC undisputed claim over Nyasaland.  Rhodes thus fully funded the establishment of Johnston’s administration.  Johnston played a major role in subjecting the area later to be known as North Eastern Rhodesia (NER) under British Crown rule.  Sir Johnston was also instrumental in the setting up of the first form of civil service in NER, and which was later improved by his successors Alfred Sharpe and later [[Robert Edward Codrington]].

Based in Blantyre, Johnston was concerned about the influence of the Belgians and Germans in the [[Congo Free State]] north of Lake Mweru.  He was aware that the 2 German expeditions had visited the area in the 1870s and that both were keen to take control of the area.  In order to show British administrative authority and determination to prevent the absorption of NER by the Belgians or Germans, Sir Johnston decided to send a former hunter and now agent of the African Lakes Company, Richard Crawshay, to set up a permanent post on the shores of Lake Mweru in 1890.  Crawshay found a spot at Puta, where Chienge stream enters Lake Mweru and set up residence there.  The area north of Puta at Mpweto in the Congo Free State was under the administrative control of a Belgian named Captain Jacques.  Although the Berlin Conference had more or less divided Africa up by colonial powers, there were no distinct boundaries between Congo Free State and North Eastern Rhodesia.  As the Germans had shifted their interest to Tanganyika and Zanzibar where they had set posts, Sir Johnston therefore decided to meet with the only real threat, the Belgian administrator Captain Jacques, and together they agreed on a boundary that would be a line running from the northern tip end of Lake Mweru where the Lualaba leaves Lake Mweru to Cape Akalunga on Lake Tanganyika.  This understanding while respected by the establishment of Chienge post, it was not formalised until four years later. The formal agreements on the boundary between the Congo Free State under King Leopold of Belgium and the British Crown of King George represented by Sir Johnston through the African Lakes Company was finalised and signed on 12 May 1894.

Having secured the British post, and boundary, Sir Johnston chose to change the name of Puta and instead called Puta station Rhodesia, after his colleague and financial mentor Cecil Rhodes, also making it the first place historically to bear that name.  Crawshay stayed at Rhodesia from 1890 to 1891 when he abandoned the station and returned to Blantyre in Nyasaland.

The peoples living under the administrative control of the [[Africa Lakes Company]] in the Lake Mweru region included the Ba Bwile or Ba Ansa under Chiefs Mpweto, Puta, Kalembwe, and Mwabu. Their neighbours to the west were the Shila under Chief Mununga, Nkula and Nshimba, there were to the South the Swahili and the Tabwa under Nsama and Katele.  There were also regular visits from the Arabs of the east coast of Africa who were involved in trading in guns, gunpowder, and slaves.   For the African Lakes Company, the most important posts were [[Abercorn (Northern Rhodesia)|Abercorn]] on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and Rhodesia on Lake Mweru’s shores, but of similar importance were Sumbu and Kaputa.  The people of Kaputa specialized in salt making and bought food from more fertile areas.  Johnston was concerned that Crawshay had left the Rhodesia station hastily, and asked Cecil Rhodes to fund a special tour of the area by his second in command to assess the situation there.   Cecil Rhodes obliged and Alfred Sharpe, Johnston’s second in command undertook a tour of the area.

When Alfred Sharpe toured the major posts in the Lake Mweru region including Rhodesia (Puta post) and Kaputa, he found that Abdullah bin Suleiman, (known by locals as Selemani) a Swahili chief who lived 60 miles from Kalungwishi, had driven out the people there and was demanding salt tribute from other villages. There was also evidence of slave traders harassing the inhabitants mercilessly.   On his return to Blantyre, Sharpe gave a detailed report to Johnston. Sir Johnston decided to reopen the station and sent 2 agents, Kidd and Bainbridge to take control of Rhodesia and continue to show British administrative authority.  However, Kidd and Bainbridge did not go to Rhodesia, but instead built a new post at Kafulwe some twenty kilometres from the Puta post on the shores of the [[Kalungwishi River|Kalungwishi river]] where it crossed the old road to Kazembe, some 3 miles east off Lake Mweru.  They decided to adopt the name of Rhodesia for this post as well, seeing as the old post had been abandoned.  Kidd and Bainbridge remained at their new post until 1894 when they both died.  It was rumoured that they were poisoned.  The local people during this time were given protection by the collector at Rhodesia against the Arabs. Mkula, also known as Nsama after his father, and 4 African soldiers were recruited to assist the collector.

In 1896, Hubert T. Harrington, locally known as Chiana, was given charge over Mweru district.  He was transferred where Dr Blair Watson was in charge as collector.  Harrington described Kalungwishi as a strongly built Boma with four bastions.  Beneath its flagstones were buried Kidd and Bainbridge. He built a barge called the Scotia or Mandala boat, which was written off in 1919 and abandoned at Chienge in 1922.  The boat used to travel between Chienge and Kilwa Island.  There is oral evidence that Hube Harrington was a relation of the famous Harrington family that settled in the Western province of Zambia and are accredited with the skills of building the first Nalikwanda, the boat of the Litunga of the Balozi.   In 1899, Nasoro bin Suleiman, nicknamed Chisesa and a cousin to Abdullah bin Suleiman, was harassing the Ba Bwile and Shila peoples.   Harrington arrested Abdullah bin Suleiman and kept him in Kalungwishi prison.

The Rhodesia station was closed after the death of Kidd and Bainbridge and was not reopened until 1907, possibly due to lack of staff.  The station was returned to its original post at Puta, Chienge as a Boma.  The collectors who reopened this Boma were J. F. Sealy and GT Wenham and they stayed there for the next 3 years.  In 1908 the station was temporarily closed due to tsetse flies.  In 1909 - 10, Dr JD Brunton, Mr WH Jollyman were sent by Alfred Sharpe to Chienge to help with the sleeping sickness campaign.

The following are the administrators that manned the Chienge Boma thereafter:

1910	S Hillier
1912	G H Jones
1917	PCJ Reardon and wife (January) Reardon went mad and ended up in an asylum.
1917	VR Anley and wife (August)
1918	ACJ Elworthy (October)
1919	S Hillier (December)
1920	Matthews (March)
1920	CP Oldfield (September)
1922	Wickins and wife (April)
In November 1922, the station was closed due to lack of funds.
In April 1925 G H Morton reopened the station

1926	FO Hoare (December)
1927	G H Morton (October) He went mad and was sent to Cape Town asylum
1929	FO Hoare (January)
1929	March, Hoare contracted black water fever and died at Kafulwe on his way to Kawambwa.
1929	JB Thomson (June)
1930	SL Langford (January)
1932	EGF Thomson (March)
1932	SL Langford (September)
In 1933, the Chienge station was closed for lack of staff and funds and the lake Mweru region was amalgamated with Mporokoso.

In 1941, the African Lakes Company surveyed 2010 acres (8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land in Chienge. The ALC had a farm at Chienge where it was said that there were traces of copper.  The district was geologically surveyed by Luangwa concessions, a mining company but they retained no claims and no mines were opened.

Two Seventh Day Adventists Ellingworth and Lewis, missionaries from Chimpempe, visited Ponde mission, which was established in 1933 originally at Kalembwe.  They drowned in Lake Mweru and were buried at Ponde on 31 August 1952.

Chienge was after 1933 administered from Mporokoso, later from Kawambwa and in the 1970s, Nchelenge.  The current Senior Chief Puta (Kasoma) was christened as Hillier after the administrator Mr S Hillier.  Senior Chief Puta Kasoma was born in 1910 and installed as Chief Puta in 1937 after the death of Puta Mulolwa.

Chienge was re-established as a sub-Boma in 1973 under the Kaunda UNIP government’s administration.

Before the end of the first term of President Frederick J.T. Chiluba’s MMD government, a quiet but effective lobby for Chienge to become a full district was mounted Dr Katele Kalumba a nominated member of Parliament and Deputy Minister of Health from November 1991 to May 1996 and full Cabinet Minister of Health thereafter, paid off.  Dr Kalumba motives were clear.  He had an eye, since joining government, on standing as a Parliamentary candidate for Chienge.  A Circular No.  25/96 issued by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Local government and Housing dated 30 October 1996 declared Chienge a new district council pursuant to Section 3 of the Local Government Act No. 22 of 1996.  At the time, Bennie Mwiinga was a Minister of Local government and Housing.

The narrative following the 12–13 December 1996 Nchelenge Council meeting defined the new Chienge as the area ‘Starting from the mouth of Kefulwa River on the Lake Mweru, the boundary follows the Kefulwa river in a straight line up to the confluence of Kasinga stream.  The Boundary runs in a straight line in the north-easterly direction up to where it meets the Kapako stream; thence the boundary runs in the northerly direction along the stream up to where it meets the Kaputa-Nchelenge administrative boundary; thence it follows along the Kaputa-Nchelenge administrative boundary in the northerly direction up to the Zambia-Zaire international boundary; thence the boundary continues in the westerly direction from the Musungwishi river along the Kaputa-Nchelenge administrative boundary; then it runs in a straight line along the Zambia-Zaire international boundary up to the mouth of Lualaba river where it flows out of lake Mweru.  The boundary thence follows the Zambia-Zaire international boundary along the lake Mweru up to the mouth of Kefulwa River, the point of starting”.

Chienge was reborn after 106 years of its first opening. It was inaugurated on Friday the 20 December 1996 witnessed by the newly elected Member of Parliament for Chienge and Minister of Health Dr Katele Kalumba and scores of Party and Government officials. Sitting as a councillor of Chienge, Dr Kalumba, accompanied by the Commissioner of Town and Country Planning in the Ministry of Local Government Dr Khonje, the Director of Health Planning and Development, Mr Vincent Musowe of the Ministry of Health, and presided over by Mr T.S. Phiri, Council Secretary for Nchelenge, witnessed the election of Mr Mwanda of Senior Chief Puta's area as the first Council Chairman of the new Chienge, while Mr Bowa from Senior Chief Mununga’s area was his Vice Chairman.

[[File:Carta da Africa meridional portugueza - coordenada por A. A. d'Oliveira - btv1b53062038k.jpg|thumb|The original Pink Map (1886)]]
The '''Pink Map''' ({{Langx|pt|Mapa cor-de-rosa}}), also known as the '''Rose-Coloured Map''',<ref>Teresa Pinto Coelho (2006). ''Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations'', p. 2.</ref> was a map prepared in 1885 to represent the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]'s claim of sovereignty over a land corridor connecting the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]] of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The area claimed included most of modern-day [[Zimbabwe]] and large parts of modern-day [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]]. 

In the first half of the 19th century, Portugal held total control over only a small number of coastal settlements in Angola and Mozambique. The Portuguese also claimed [[suzerainty]] over other ''de facto'' independent towns and nominal Portuguese subjects in the [[Zambezi]] valley, but could rarely enforce its claims; most of the territory now within Angola and Mozambique was entirely independent of Portugal's control. Between 1840 and 1869, Portugal expanded the area it controlled but felt threatened by the activities of other European colonial powers in the region.

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] refused to acknowledge Portugal's claims in Africa which were not based on effective occupation, including a Portuguese offer in 1889 to abandon their claim to a transcontinental link in exchange for British recognition of other claims. The [[1890 British Ultimatum]] ended Portuguese claims based on the [[discovery doctrine]] and recent exploration. The dispute seriously damaged the prestige of Portugal's monarchy among the Portuguese public, which rapidly turned to republicanism.<ref>C E Nowell, (1982). The rose-colored map: Portugal's attempt to build an African empire from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean.</ref>

==Portuguese possessions 1800–1870==
[[Image:Mapa Cor-de-Rosa.svg|thumb|The Rose-Coloured Map—Portugal's claim of sovereignty of the land between [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]].]]

===In Angola===
At the start of the 19th century, effective [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] governance in Africa south of the [[equator]] was limited. Portuguese Angola consisted of areas around [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]], and a few almost independent towns over which Portugal claimed suzerainty, the most northerly being [[Ambriz]].<ref>R Oliver and A Atmore, (1986). The African Middle Ages, 1400–1800, pp. 163–4, 191, 195.</ref> In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Angola's main function within the [[Portuguese Empire]] was supplying [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] with slaves. This was facilitated first by the development of coffee plantations in southern Brazil from the 1790s onward, and second by the 1815 and 1817 agreements between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and Portugal limiting—at least on paper—Portuguese slave trading to areas south of the equator.<ref>J C Miller, (1988). Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730–1830, pp. 261, 269–70.</ref> This trade diminished after Brazilian independence in 1822 and more sharply following an 1830 agreement between Britain and Brazil by which the Brazilian government prohibited further imports of slaves.<ref>J C Miller, (1988). Way of Death: Merchant Capitalism and the Angolan Slave Trade, 1730–1830, p. 637.</ref> To find people for export as slaves from Angolan towns, Afro-Portuguese traders penetrated as far inland as [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and [[Kazembe]], but otherwise few Portuguese moved inland and they did not attempt to establish control there.<ref>R Oliver and A Atmore, (1986). The African Middle Ages, 1400–1800, pp. 137.</ref> When the Brazilian slave trade declined, the Portuguese began using slaves for agricultural work on plantations stretching inland from Luanda along the [[Cuanza River]], and to a lesser extent around Benguela. After the Portuguese founded [[Namibe Province|Moçâmedes]], south of Benguela, in 1840 and occupied Ambriz in 1855, Portugal controlled a continuous coastal strip from Ambriz to Moçâmedes, but little inland territory.<ref>P E Lovejoy, (2012). Transformations in Slavery, 3rd edition, pp. 230–1.</ref> Although Portugal claimed the [[Congo River]] estuary, Britain at best accepted limited Portuguese trading rights in the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] enclave north of the river, although these rights did not make Cabinda Portuguese territory.<ref>W. G. Clarence-Smith, (1985)The Third Portuguese Empire 1825–1975, p. 36</ref><ref>R J Hammond, (1966). Portugal and Africa: 1815–1910, pp. 54–5.</ref>

===In Mozambique===
Portugal had occupied parts of the Mozambique coast since the 16th century, but at the start of the 19th century Portuguese presence was limited to [[Island of Mozambique|Mozambique Island]], [[Ibo, Mozambique|Ibo]] and [[Quelimane]] in northern Mozambique, outposts at [[Vila de Sena|Sena]] and [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] in the Zambezi valley, [[Sofala]] to the south of the Zambezi, and the port town [[Inhambane]] further south. Although Delagoa Bay was regarded as Portuguese territory, [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] was not settled until 1781, and was temporarily abandoned after a 1796 French raid.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 129, 137, 159–63.</ref> In the late 18th century most of the people exported as slaves through Portuguese settlements in Mozambique were sent to [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]], at that time both French colonies, but the [[Napoleonic Wars]] disrupted this trade, and by the early 19th century the Portuguese sent Mozambican slaves to Brazil.<ref>P E Lovejoy, (2012). Transformations in Slavery, 3rd edition, p. 146.</ref> As was the case with Angola, slave exports declined after 1830 and were partly replaced by exports of ivory through Lourenço Marques from the 1840s onward.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 248, 292–3.</ref>

The nadir of Portuguese fortunes in Mozambique came in the 1830s and 1840s when Lourenço Marques was sacked in 1833<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 262.</ref> and [[Sofala]] in 1835.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 260.</ref> [[Zumbo]] was abandoned in 1836 and the [[Gaza Empire]] forced Afro-Portuguese settlers near [[Vila de Sena]] to pay tribute.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 260, 282, 287.</ref> Although Portugal claimed [[sovereignty]] over [[Angoche]] and a number of smaller Muslim coastal towns, these were virtually independent at the start of the 19th century. However, after Portugal renounced the slave trade, these towns continued the practice. Fearing British or French anti-slavery interventions, Portugal began bringing these towns under stricter control. Angoche resisted and fought off a Portuguese warship attempting to prevent slave trading in 1847. It took another military expedition and occupation in 1860–1 to end Angoche's slave trade.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 272–5.</ref> 

Portugal also initiated the [[Prazo]] system of large leased estates under nominal Portuguese rule in the Zambezi valley. By the end of the 18th century, the valleys of the Zambezi and lower [[Shire River]] were controlled by a few families who claimed to be Portuguese subjects but who were virtually independent. However, starting in 1840 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns in an attempt to bring the prazos under its control. Portuguese troops suffered several major setbacks before forcing the last prazo to submit in 1869.<ref>M Newitt, (1969). The Portuguese on the Zambezi: An Historical Interpretation of the Prazo system, pp. 67–8, 80–2.</ref>

In other inland areas, there was not even the pretence of Portuguese control. In the interior of what is today southern and central Mozambique, [[Nguni people]] who had entered the area from South Africa under their leader [[Soshangane]] created the [[Gaza Empire]] in the 1830s and, up to Soshangane's death in 1856, dominated southern Mozambique outside the two towns of Inhambane and Lourenço Marques. Lourenço Marques only remained in Portuguese hands in the 1840s and early 1850s because the [[Swazi people]] vied with Gaza for its control.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 262, 293–5.</ref> After Soshangane's death two of his sons struggled for succession, with the eventual winner [[Mzila]] coming to power with Portuguese help in 1861. Under Mzila the centre of Gaza power moved north to central Mozambique and came into conflict with the prazo owners who were expanding south from the Zambezi valley.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 289–91.</ref>

As in Angola, during the 18th century Afro-Portuguese traders employed by the Mozambican prazo owners penetrated inland from the Zambezi valley as far as Kazembe in search of ivory and copper. In 1798 [[Francisco de Lacerda]], a Portuguese officer based in Mozambique, organised an expedition from Tete to the interior hoping to reach Kazembe, but he died en route in what is now Zambia. Antonio Gamitto tried to establish commercial relations with Kazembe peoples in the upper Zambezi valley in 1831 also without success. Apart from Lacerda's expedition, none of the trading ventures into the interior from Angola or Mozambique had official status and were not attempts to bring the area between Angola and Mozambique under Portuguese control. Even Lacerda's expedition was largely commercial in purpose, although it was later declared by the Lisbon Geographical Society to have established claim to the area it covered.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 211, 229, 268, 276.</ref>

===Elsewhere===
After Brazilian independence and the loss of most Asian territories, Portuguese colonial expansion focused on Africa. In the late 1860s Lisbon had no effective presence in the area between Angola and Mozambique, and little presence in many areas lying within the present-day borders of those countries. By the second half of the 19th century, various European powers developed an increasing interest in Africa. The first challenge to Portugal's territorial claims came from the area around Delagoa Bay. The [[Boer]]s who founded the [[South African Republic]] were concerned British occupation of the bay would threaten their independence, and to prevent this they claimed their own outlet to the Indian Ocean at Delagoa Bay in 1868. Although Portugal and the Transvaal reached agreement in 1869 on a border under which all of Delagoa Bay remained Portuguese, Britain then lodged a claim to the bay's southern part. This claim was rejected in 1875 after [[arbitration]] by French [[Patrice de MacMahon|President MacMahon]], which upheld the 1869 borders.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 327–9.</ref>

A further significant issue arose in the areas south and west of [[Lake Malawi|Lake Nyasa]] (now also known as Lake Malawi), which [[David Livingstone]] reached in the 1850s. In the 1860s and 1870s [[Church of England|Anglicans]] and Presbyterians established several missions in the [[Shire Highlands]], including a mission and small trading settlement founded at [[Blantyre]] in 1876. In 1878 businessmen linked to the Presbyterian missions established the [[African Lakes Company]], which aimed to set up a trading venture that would work in close co-operation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and to develop European influence in the area.<ref>J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp.77–9.</ref> Later, another challenge came from the foundation of a German colony at [[Angra Pequena]] (present-day [[Lüderitz]]) in Namibia in 1883. Although there was no Portuguese presence this far south Portugal claimed the Namibian coast, being the first European nation to have visited it.<ref>

==Portuguese exploration and early negotiation attempts==
Though the Lacerda and Gamitto expeditions were largely commercial, the third quarter of the nineteenth century saw scientific African expeditions. The Portuguese government was suspicious of exploration by other European nations, particularly those whose leasers held an official (often consular) position as Livingstone had, which their home countries could use to claim territory Portugal regarded as its own. To prevent this the Lisbon Geographical Society and the Geographical Commission of the Portuguese Ministry of Marine—at that time responsible for overseas territories as well as the navy—created a joint commission in 1875 to plan scientific expeditions to the area between Angola and Mozambique.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). ''A History of Mozambique'', pp. 334–35.</ref>

Although Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Andrade Corvo]] doubted Portugal's ability to achieve coast-to-coast empire, he sanctioned expeditions. Portuguese soldier and explorer [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto]] led three such expeditions through which Portugal could attempt to assert its African territorial claims. The first was from Mozambique to the eastern Zambezi in 1869, the second to the [[Congo River]] and upper Zambezi from Angola in 1876, and the last in 1877–79 crossing Africa from Angola with the intention of claiming the area between Angola and Mozambique. In 1877 Portuguese explorers [[Hermenegildo Capelo]] and [[Roberto Ivens]] led an expedition from Luanda towards the Congo basin. Capelo made a second journey from Angola to Mozambique, largely following existing trade routes, in 1884–85.<ref>C E Nowell, (1947). ''Portugal and the Partition of Africa'', pp. 6–8.</ref><ref>M Newitt, (1995). ''A History of Mozambique'', pp. 335–36.</ref>

During and after the Serpa Pinto and Capelo expeditions, the Portuguese government attempted bilateral negotiations with Britain. In 1879 as part of talks on a treaty on the freedom of navigation on the Congo and Zambezi rivers and the development of trade in those river basins, Portugal formally claimed the area south and east of the [[Ruo River]] (the present southeastern border of Malawi).<ref>M Newitt, (1995). ''A History of Mozambique'', p. 330.</ref> The 1879 treaty was never ratified, and in 1882 Portugal occupied the lower Shire River valley as far as the Ruo, after which its government again asked Britain to accept this territorial claim, without success.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). ''A History of Malawi, 1859–1966'', p. 51.</ref> Further bilateral negotiations led to a draft treaty in February 1884, which would have included British recognition of Portuguese sovereignty over the mouth of the Congo in exchange for freedom of navigation on the Congo and Zambezi rivers, but the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85 ended these discussions which could have led to British recognition of Portuguese influence stretching across the continent.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). ''A History of Mozambique'', pp. 331–2.</ref> Portugal's efforts to establish a corridor of influence between Angola and Mozambique without gaining full political control were hampered by one of the articles in the General Act of the Berlin Conference requiring effective occupation of areas claimed rather than relying on historical claims based on early discovery or more recent claims based largely on exploration, as Portugal wished to use.<ref>Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, p. 2. http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/windsor/6_pintocoelho.pdf</ref>

To validate Portuguese claims, Serpa Pinto was appointed as Portuguese consul in [[Zanzibar]] in 1884 with the mission of exploring the region between Lake Nyasa and the coast from the Zambezi to the [[Ruvuma River]] and securing the allegiance of chiefs in that area.<ref>C E Nowell, (1947). ''Portugal and the Partition of Africa'', p. 10.</ref> His expedition reached Lake Nyasa and the Shire Highlands but failed to make treaties of protection with chiefs in territories west of the lake.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). ''A History of Mozambique'', pp. 276–77, 325–26.</ref> At the northwest end of Lake Nyasa around [[Karonga]] the African Lakes Company made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs between 1884 and 1886. Its ambition was to become a [[chartered company]] and control the route from the lake along the Shire River. Its further ambition to control the Shire Highlands was given up in 1886 following protests from local missionaries that it could not police this area effectively.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). ''A History of Malawi, 1859–1966'', pp. 48–52.</ref>

==The Berlin Conference==
{{main|Berlin Conference}}
The General Act of the Berlin Conference dated 26 February 1885 introduced the principle of effective occupation, potentially damaging Portuguese claims, particularly in Mozambique where other powers were active. Article 34 required a nation acquiring land on the coasts of Africa outside of its previous possessions to notify the other signatories of the Act so they could protest such claims. Article 35 of the Act provided that rights could only be acquired over previously uncolonised lands if the power claiming them had established sufficient authority there to protect existing rights and free trade. This implied making treaties with local rulers, establishing colonial administration, and exercising police powers. Initially Portugal claimed the Berlin Treaty did not apply to its territories and that Portugal was not required to issue notifications or establish effective occupation, as Portugal's claim to the Mozambique coast had existed unchallenged for centuries.<ref>A Keppel-Jones (1983) Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe 1884–1902, pp 190–1.</ref><ref>The General Act of the Berlin Conference. http://africanhistory.about.com/od/eracolonialism/l/bl-BerlinAct1885.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514005128/http://africanhistory.about.com/od/eracolonialism/l/bl-BerlinAct1885.htm |date=14 May 2013 }}</ref>

British officials did not accept this interpretation and in January 1884 [[Henry E. O'Neill]], the British consul based at Mozambique Island, stated:

<blockquote>To speak of Portuguese colonies in East Africa is to speak of a mere fiction—a fiction colourably sustained by a few scattered seaboard settlements, beyond whose narrow littoral and local limits colonisation and government have no existence.""<ref>Quoted in J C Paiva de Andrada, (1885). ''Relatorio de uma viagem ás terras dos Landins'', at Project Gutenberg, https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34041/34041-h/34041-h.htm</ref></blockquote>

To forestall British designs on Mozambique and the interior that O'Neill claimed Portugal did not occupy, Portugal in 1884 commissioned its soldier Joaquim Carlos Paiva de Andrada to establish effective occupation. He was active in four areas: first, in 1884 he established the town of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] and occupied [[Sofala Province]]. Also in 1884, he acquired a concession of an area within a {{convert|180|km|mi|adj=on}} radius of Zumbo, west of where Afro-Portuguese families had traded and settled since the 1860s. Andrada only established colonial administration in 1889, when he founded an outpost beyond the confluence of the Zambezi and [[Kafue River|Kafue]] rivers and an administrative district based at Zumbo .<ref>J C Paiva de Andrada, (1886). Relatorio de uma viagem ás terras do Changamira, at Project Gutenberg, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34040/34040-h/34040-h.htm .</ref><ref>J C Paiva de Andrada, (1885). Relatorio de uma viagem ás terras dos Landins,</ref><ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 337–8, 344.</ref> In 1889 Andrada was granted another concession over Manica, covering today's [[Manica Province]] of Mozambique and [[Manicaland Province]] of Zimbabwe. Andrada obtained treaties over much of this area and established a rudimentary administration before he was arrested and expelled in November 1890 by the [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP). Finally, in 1889 Andrada crossed northern Mashonaland (present-day Zimbabwe's [[Mashonaland Central Province]]) to obtain treaties. He failed to inform the Portuguese government of these treaties, so other powers were not formally notified of the claims as the Berlin Treaty required.

==The Pink Map==
===Portuguese transcontinental claims===
Despite the outcome of the Berlin Conference and failed bilateral negotiations with Britain, Portugal continued pursuing a contiguous, transcontinental colonial territory. In 1885 the Portuguese Foreign Minister Barros Gomes published the so-called Pink or Rose-Coloured Map, a map representing a formal Portuguese claim to sovereignty over an area stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean.<ref>W. G. Clarence-Smith, (1985)The Third Portuguese Empire 1825–1975, p. 83</ref> Portugal attempted to solidify the claim by signing treaties with France and Germany in 1886. To obtain the French treaty, Portugal relinquished its claim to the area around the [[Casamance River]] in [[Guinea]] in exchange for vague recognition of the Portuguese claim to an undefined area between Angola and Mozambique, with the Rose-Coloured Map attached to the treaty for information. To obtain a similar treaty with Germany, Portugal agreed to a southern boundary for Angola and northern boundary for Mozambique favourable to Germany. France and Germany's ""noting"" the Portuguese claims did not amount to their accepting the claims, only recognition that Portugal made such claims.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 341–3.</ref><ref>Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, pp. 2–3.</ref>

===Post–Pink Map negotiation attempts===

British Prime Minister [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] formally protested the Rose-Coloured Map, but initially made no claim to the territories it represented. In July 1887 Salisbury stated the British government would not accept any Portuguese claim unless there were sufficient Portuguese forces in the claimed area to maintain order. The Portuguese government thought this meant Britain would accept a claim backed by effective occupation.<ref>H V Livermore, (1966) A New History of Portugal, pp. 305–6.</ref> Later in that year, the British [[Diplomatic rank|minister]] in [[Lisbon]] proposed the Zambezi as the northern limit of British influence. This would have stranded Scottish missionaries in the Shire Highlands within the Portuguese zone and created a band of Portuguese territory linking Angola and Mozambique, though one significantly smaller than the Rose-Coloured Map proposed, as all of what is now Zimbabwe would be British territory. Portugal rejected the proposal because the Shire Highlands and Scottish missions could only be accessed through Portuguese coastal areas, and because the proposal would involve giving up the southern and more valuable half of the transcontinental zone claimed in the Rose-Coloured Map, apparently for little in return.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 343–4.</ref>

By 1889 the Portuguese government felt less confident and its [[Foreign Minister]] Barros Gomes informed the British government Portugal was willing to abandon its claim to a zone linking Angola and Mozambique in exchange for recognition of its claim to the Shire Highlands. This time the British government rejected the proposal, partly because of the strong opposition of the Scottish missions, and partly because the [[Chinde River]] entrance to the Zambezi was discovered in April 1889. This meant oceangoing ships could now enter the Zambezi and its tributary the [[Shire River]], making them international waterways with access to the Shire Highlands.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 337, 345–6.</ref>

===British and Portuguese courting of local influence===

Later popular perception in Britain suggested the Rose-Coloured Map was a direct challenge to [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s vision of a ""[[Cape to Cairo Red Line]]"". The Cape to Cairo idea was first put forward by [[Harry Johnston|Henry ""Harry"" Hamilton Johnston]] in an August 1888 newspaper article three years after the Pink Map's publication and only later adopted by Rhodes. His [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) was founded in October 1888 and only received its [[royal charter]] enabling it to trade with local rulers; to buy, sell, and own land; and to operate a police force in Matabeleland and adjacent areas south of the Zambezi River in October 1889.<ref>H V Livermore (1966). ''A New History of Portugal'', pp. 306–7.</ref> From the incorporation of the BSAC, Rhodes and the company opposed Portuguese claims south of the Zambezi, and Rhodes made no secret of his intention to seize part of Mozambique to gain an outlet to the Indian Ocean.<ref>R I Rotberg, (1988). ''The Founder: Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power'', pp. 304–12</ref> North of the Zambezi, Portuguese claims to the Shire Highlands were opposed by the African Lakes Company and the missionaries, the latter supported by public opinion, especially in Scotland.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). ''A History of Mozambique'', p. 341.</ref> As late as 1888 the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] declined protection to the tiny British settlements in the Shire Highlands. It did not accept expansion of Portuguese influence there, and in 1889 it appointed Harry Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, instructing him to report on the extent of Portuguese presence in the Zambezi and Shire valleys. He was also to make conditional treaties with local rulers outside Portuguese control. These conditional treaties did not establish a British protectorate, but prevented the rulers from accepting protection from another state.<ref>J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 83–5.</ref>

In 1888 Portuguese government representatives in Mozambique organised two expeditions to make treaties of protection with the [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] chiefs southeast of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire Highlands to establish Portuguese territorial claims. The first expedition under António Cardoso, former governor of [[Quelimane]], set off in November 1888 for Lake Nyasa. The second expedition under Serpa Pinto, now governor of Mozambique, moved up the Shire Valley. The two expeditions resulted in over 20 treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, pp. 52–3.</ref> Serpa Pinto's expedition was well armed, partly in response to a Portuguese resident's request for help in resolving disturbances caused by the [[Kololo people|Makololo]] chiefs on the lower Shire River. David Livingstone had brought the Makololo into the area during his Zambezi expedition, and they remained on the Shire north and west of the Ruo River when the expedition ended in 1864. The Makololo claimed to be outside Portuguese control, and asked for British assistance to remain independent.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 282, 346.</ref> Serpa Pinto met with British consul Harry Johnston in August 1889 east of the Ruo, when Johnston advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands.<ref>J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 85–6.</ref>

British settlers living in the Shire Highlands probably encouraged the Makololo to attack Serpa Pinto, resulting in a minor battle between Pinto's Portuguese troops and the Makololo on 8 November 1889 near the Shire River.<ref name=""auto"">M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 346–7.</ref> Although Serpa Pinto had previously acted with caution, he then crossed the Ruo into what is now Malawi.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859–1966, pp. 53, 55.</ref> When Pinto occupied much Makololo territory, Johnston's vice-consul John Buchanan accused Portugal of ignoring British interests in this area and declared a British protectorate over the Shire Highlands in December 1889, despite contrary instructions.<ref name=""auto""/> Shortly after this, Johnston declared a further protectorate over the area to the west of Lake Nyasa, also contrary to his instructions, although both protectorates were later endorsed by the Foreign Office.<ref>R I Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa: The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873–1964, p.15.</ref> These actions formed the background to an Anglo-Portuguese crisis in which a British refusal of [[arbitration]] was followed by the [[1890 British Ultimatum]].<ref>F Axelson, (1967). Portugal and the Scramble for Africa, pp. 233–6.</ref>

==Resolution==
===1890 ultimatum===
The [[1890 British Ultimatum]] is a memorandum Prime Minister [[Lord Salisbury]] sent to the Portuguese government on 11 January 1890 in which he demanded the withdrawal of Portuguese troops from Mashonaland and Matabeleland (now Zimbabwe) and from the area between the Shire River north of the Ruo and Lake Nyasa (including all the Shire Highlands), where Portuguese and British interests overlapped. The ultimatum meant Britain now claimed sovereignty over territories Portugal had claimed for centuries. There was no dispute regarding the borders of Angola, as neither country effectively occupied any part of the sparsely populated border area.<ref>Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, p. 1.</ref> Historians have argued that Lord Salisbury's diplomatically isolated government used tactics that could have led to war because they feared humiliation from Portuguese success.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 347.</ref> King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] accepted the ultimatum, causing anti-British demonstrations and riots in Portugal. Portuguese republicans used it as an excuse to attack the government, and staged a failed January 1891 coup d’état in [[Porto]].<ref name=""auto1"">Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, pp. 4–5.</ref>

Though the ultimatum required Portugal cease activity in the disputed areas, it did not restrict further British occupation there. Between the British issuing the ultimatum and the signing of a [[Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891|treaty]] in Lisbon on 11 June 1891, both Britain and Portugal tried to occupy more of the disputed areas and assert their authority. Although the Portuguese established rudimentary administration in [[Manicaland Province|Manicaland]] in 1884 and strengthened this in 1889 before there was BSAC presence in the area, in November 1890, BSAP personnel arrested and expelled the Portuguese officials in an attempt to gain access to the coast and there were armed clashes between Rhodes's men and Portuguese troops already in Manicaland. The British government refused to accept existing Portuguese administration; fighting only stopped when Rhodes's company was awarded part of Manicaland. Buchanan further asserted British sovereignty over the Shire Highlands by executing two Afro-Portuguese [[Sepoy|cipais]] (soldiers), claiming they were within British jurisdiction.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 350–1, 354–5.</ref>

===Bilateral treaty===
The General Act of the Berlin Conference required arbitration of disputes. After the ultimatum Portugal requested arbitration, but because the 1875 Delagoa Bay arbitration had favoured of Portugal, Lord Salisbury refused and demanded a bilateral treaty. Talks started in Lisbon in April 1890, and in May the Portuguese delegation proposed joint administration of the disputed area. The British government refused, drafting a treaty that imposed boundaries generally unfavourable to Portugal.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 347, 352–3.</ref> This led to a wave of protests and dissolution of the [[Cortes Gerais|Portuguese Parliament]] when the draft treaty was published.<ref name=""auto1""/> This treaty did grant Portugal rights to build a railway, road, and telegraph line along the Zambezi River's north bank, which would have provided a limited link between Angola and Mozambique.<ref>M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, p. 353.</ref>

The new Portuguese Parliament refused to ratify the agreement in August 1890, leading to further negotiations. The 1891 draft treaty granted Portugal more territory in the Zambezi Valley than the 1890 treaty, in exchange for Portugal's giving up what is now the [[Manicaland Province]] of Zimbabwe. This treaty also set Angola's borders and provided for freedom of navigation on the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Britain and Portugal signed the treaty in Lisbon on 11 June 1891. However, it gave Portugal no special rights along the Zambezi's northern bank, effectively ending Portugal's Pink Map project.<ref>Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, pp. 6–7.</ref>

==Synopsis and structure==
'''Tears of Rain: Ethnicity and History in Central Western Zambia''' focuses on the Nkoya people in western Zambia and their changing identity. The book includes a historical text called ''Likota lya Bankoya'', written in the 1950s by Rev. Johasaphat Shimunika, a Nkoya pastor. Van Binsbergen translated and analyzed this text to explore how Nkoya identity was shaped by colonialism, local politics, and oral tradition.<ref name=ferguson-tears>{{cite journal |last=Ferguson |first=James |title=Review of Tears of Rain: Ethnicity and History in Central Western Zambia |journal=Africa |volume=63 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=269–272 |jstor=1160848}}</ref><ref name=hansen-tears>{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Karen Tranberg |title=Review of Tears of Rain: Ethnicity and History in Central Western Zambia |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=41 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=508–510 |jstor=481856}}</ref><ref name=vansina-tears>{{cite journal |last=Vansina |first=Jan |title=Review of Tears of Rain: Ethnicity and History in Central Western Zambia |journal=Anthropos |volume=88 |issue=1/3 |year=1993 |pages=215–217 |jstor=40462764}}</ref> he book shows how the Nkoya used history to claim recognition and resist domination by the [[Lozi people]].

== Origin of Ngoni kings ==
The origins of the Ngoni can be traked down in South Africa in the early years of the nineteenth century. The first contact of M'Mbelwa kings with the Livingstonia Church mission in Malawi was in the early 1878. This was the time when they had left South Africa due to tribal wars with the Zulu king.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |date=2022-08-16 |title=M’mbelwa Kingdom, Jele Ngoni of Malawi - THE AFRICAN ROYAL FAMILIES |url=https://theafricanroyalfamilies.com/2022/08/16/mombela-kingdom-ngoni-of-malawi/ |access-date=2023-11-23 |website=theafricanroyalfamilies.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Background==

=== Early life ===
M'mbelwa V was born in Mzimba district on 2 June 1985. His father the late King M'mbelwa IV  passed away in February 2013.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":0"" /> He  holds a Diploma.<ref name="":1""/> In 2017, M'Mbelwa proposed the Malawi government to recognize Mzimba district as a kingdom controlled district to preserve the power hierarchy. This was due to tension that rose from other group of people known as the Friends of Mabilabo who wanted to have another Ngoni paramount chief within the district.<ref name="":4"">{{Cite web |last=Singini |first=George |date=2017-05-22 |title=M'mbelwa wants throne protected |url=https://mwnation.com/mmbelwa-wants-throne-protected/ |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=The Nation Online |language=en-US}}</ref> Senior Chief Mabilabo claimed to have never heard of such news for the call for the paramount chief in his area.<ref name="":4"" />

M'mbelwa District Council (Mzimba) ward councillors who were pushing for the division of Mzimba criticised M'mbelwa for prioritising kingdom talk, as the district need to be split into two for easy development programs. Fumu Mdolo who brought news to King M'Mbelwa about splitting the district said the idea was dividing the district, and not the kingdom.<ref name="":4"" />

== Origin of Ngoni Kings ==
The origins of the Ngoni can be traked down in South Africa in the early years of the nineteenth century. The first contact of M'Mbelwa kings with the Livingstonia Church mission in Malawi was in the early 1878. This was the time when had they left South Africa due to tribal wars with the Zulu king.<ref name="":3"" />

Mbelwa I was the son of Zwangendaba, who at the time, married a Swazi woman, Munene. He was born at Mabili in Malawi in 1840.

'''Zwangendaba Gwaza kaZiguda Jele Gumbi''', commonly known as '''Zwangendaba''' (1785–1848), was the first king of the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] and [[Tumbuka people|Tumbuka]] of [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], and [[Tanzania]], from the Jere Ngoni clan. He reigned from 1815 to 1848.<ref name=""theafricanroyalfamilies.com"">{{Cite web |date=2024-02-12 |title=M'mbelwa Kingdom, Jele Ngoni of Malawi - THE AFRICAN ROYAL FAMILIES |url=https://theafricanroyalfamilies.com/2024/02/12/mombela-kingdom-ngoni-of-malawi/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=theafricanroyalfamilies.com |language=en-US |archive-date=2024-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240228090218/https://theafricanroyalfamilies.com/2024/02/12/mombela-kingdom-ngoni-of-malawi/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="":3"">{{Cite web |url=https://wap.org.ng/read/notable-wives-and-royal-sons-of-nguni-king-mmbelwa-i/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2024-02-29 |archive-date=2024-02-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240229204313/https://wap.org.ng/read/notable-wives-and-royal-sons-of-nguni-king-mmbelwa-i/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Zwangendaba was the elder brother of Somkhanda kaZiguda Jele, also known as Gumbi, who founded the Gumbi clan in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in areas around [[Pongola, KwaZulu-Natal|Pongola]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-20 |title=NOTABLE WIVES AND ROYAL SONS OF NGUNI KING, M'MBELWA I - Wap.org.ng |url=https://wap.org.ng/read/notable-wives-and-royal-sons-of-nguni-king-mmbelwa-i/ |access-date=2024-02-29 |archive-date=2023-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231120105705/https://wap.org.ng/read/notable-wives-and-royal-sons-of-nguni-king-mmbelwa-i/ |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>

Zwangendaba was initially part of the [[Ndwandwe|Ndwandwe Kingdom]] under King Zwide. However, after defeating the Ndwandwe forces, Zwangendaba and his clan, the Jele, broke away. This event occurred during the [[Mfecane]] - a period of mass migration among the northern Nguni peoples. Zwangendaba led his people on a migration, which lasted over 1,000 miles (1,600 km), spanning over two decades. Their journey took them through what is now northern South Africa, [[Mozambique]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], and [[Malawi]], ultimately reaching the western part of [[Tanzania]]. Zwangendaba established a base at Mapupo, and his clan expanded its influence throughout the region.

Following his death, the Ngoni people fractured into three groups, spreading their dominion across Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia.

==Fighting tactics==
Zwangendaba adopted many of [[Shaka Zulu]]'s warfare strategies, incorporating rigid discipline into military and social organization. This approach helped him unite his people and those they conquered into a cohesive force. With his people, Zwangendaba migrated north into tropical Africa.<ref name="":3"" />

In 1835, during their migration, the Ngoni crossed the Zambezi River on the day of a total solar eclipse. According to legend, Zwangendaba used Nguni esoteric knowledge and occult science to part the waters of the river, creating a path for his people—an event reminiscent of the Biblical parting of the Red Sea.<ref name="":3"" />

As they advanced northward, ravaging the territories they passed through, the Ngoni eventually reached the southwestern part of present-day Tanzania. Upon Zwangendaba's death in 1848, the Ngoni people split into three groups: one settled in Malawi, another in Songea (Tanzania), and the third migrated north to Mbogwe in Usumbwa, where they fought against the renowned Mirambo of Unyamwezi.<ref name="":3"" />

The current king of the Ngoni is Zwangendaba's great-great-grandson, [[M'Mbelwa V]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mkandawire |first=Mwayi |date=2020-03-16 |title=Coronavirus: M'mbelwa urges Mutharika to ban mass gatherings Malawi 24 {{!}} Latest News from Malawi |url=https://malawi24.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-mmbelwa-urges-mutharika-to-ban-public-gatherings/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=Malawi 24 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporter |first=Malawi24 |date=2019-08-12 |title=M'mbelwa calls on Ngonis to preserve culture with responsibility Malawi 24 {{!}} Latest News from Malawi |url=https://malawi24.com/2019/08/12/mmbelwa-calls-on-ngonis-to-preserve-culture-with-responsibility/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=Malawi 24 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Zgambo |first=Mike Lyson |date=2020-04-28 |title=Mzimba chief under fire for pushing for nullification of parliamentary polls Malawi 24 {{!}} Latest News from Malawi |url=https://malawi24.com/2020/04/28/mzimba-chief-under-fire-for-pushing-for-nullification-of-parliamentary-polls/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=Malawi 24 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Chisamba |first=Thula |date=2016-11-01 |title=Inkosi M'mbelwa ban on miniskirts and table cuts shocks subjects Malawi 24 {{!}} Latest News from Malawi |url=https://malawi24.com/2016/11/01/inkosi-mmbelwa-ban-miniskirts-table-cuts-shocks-subjects/ |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=Malawi 24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

{{Politics of Zambia}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2022}}
The '''politics of [[Zambia]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[president of Zambia]] is [[head of state]], [[head of government]] and leader of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. Formerly [[Northern Rhodesia]], Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining [[independence]] in October 1964.

[[Zambia]] was democratic from independence to 1973.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal |last=Bratton |first=Michael |date=1992 |title=Zambia Starts Over |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/225530 |journal=Journal of Democracy |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=81–94 |issn=1086-3214}}</ref> Zambia was a one-party state from 8 December 1972 until multi-party democracy was re-introduced on 4 December 1990 which led to multi-party elections on 1 November 1991.

== Government and constitution ==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|Section|date=August 2011}}

The constitution promulgated on 25 August 1973, abrogated the original 1964 constitution. The new constitution and the national elections that followed in December 1973 were the final steps in achieving what was called a ""one-party participatory democracy"".

The 1973 constitution provided for a strong president and a unicameral National Assembly. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP), the sole legal party in [[Zambia]]. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy.

In accordance with the intention to formalise UNIP supremacy in the new system, the constitution stipulated that the sole candidate in [[election]]s for the office of [[President (government title)|president]] was the person selected to be the president of UNIP by the party's general conference. The second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP's secretary-general.

In December 1990, at the end of a tumultuous year that included [[riot]]s in the capital and an attempted [[coup]], President Kaunda signed legislation ending UNIP's monopoly on power. In response to growing popular demand for multiparty [[democracy]], and after lengthy, difficult negotiations between the Kaunda government and opposition groups, Zambia enacted a new constitution in August 1991. The constitution enlarged the National Assembly from 136 members to a maximum of 158 members, established an electoral commission, and allowed for more than one presidential candidate who no longer had to be a member of UNIP. The constitution was amended again in 1996 to set new limits on the presidency (including a retroactive two-term limit, and a requirement that both parents of a candidate be Zambian-born). The National Assembly comprises 150 directly elected members, up to ten (usually eight) presidentially appointed members, and a speaker.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Zambia - Key Facts | url=http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/Country_profiles/Zambia.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018234327/http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/Country_profiles/Zambia.pdf | archive-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> Zambia is divided into ten [[province]]s, each administered by an appointed Provincial [[Political minister|minister]] who essentially performs the duties of a [[governor]].

As of 2010, a new constitution is in the process of being drafted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zambian-economist.com/2010/06/press-release-draft-national.html|title=Press Release : Draft National Constitution|website=www.zambian-economist.com}}</ref>

== Political history ==

The major figure in Zambian politics from 1964 to 1991 was [[Kenneth Kaunda]], who led the fight for independence and successfully bridged the rivalries among the country's various regions and ethnic groups. Kaunda tried to base government on his philosophy of ""[[humanism]]"", which condemned human [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and stressed [[cooperation]] among people, but not at the expense of the individual. During Kaunda's presidency, members of all ethnic groups were represented by ministers in the government, in relation to their demographic size.<ref name=epr>{{cite web |author=GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform |title=Ethnicity in Zambia |url=https://growup.ethz.ch/atlas/Zambia |publisher=ETH Zurich |access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>

Zambia conducted three democratic elections (1962, 1964, and 1968) after achieving independence.<ref name="":0"" /> The elections were marred by violence and irregularities, but all parties respected the election results.<ref name="":0"" />

Before 1972, Zambia had three significant political parties: the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the African National Congress (ANC), and the United Progressive Party (UPP). The ANC drew its strength from the western and southern provinces, while the UPP found some support among Bemba speakers in the Copperbelt and northern provinces. Although not strongly supported in all areas of the country, only UNIP had a nationwide following.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia (02/07) |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/zambia/80169.htm |access-date=2025-04-14 |website=U.S. Department of State}}</ref>

===One-party state===
In February 1972, Zambia became a [[one-party state]], and all other political parties were banned. Kenneth Kaunda, the sole candidate, was elected president in the 1973 elections. Elections also were held for the National Assembly. Only UNIP members were permitted to run, but these seats were sharply contested. President Kaunda's mandate was renewed in December 1978 and October 1983 in a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote on his candidacy. In the 1983 election, more than 60% of those registered participated and gave President Kaunda a 95.38% ""yes"" vote.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Elections in Zambia |url=https://africanelections.tripod.com/zm.html |access-date=2024-09-05 |website=africanelections.tripod.com}}</ref>

===1991: Move to a multiparty state===
Growing opposition to UNIP's monopoly on power led to the rise in 1990 of the [[Movement for Multiparty Democracy]] (MMD). The MMD assembled an increasingly impressive group of important Zambians, including prominent UNIP defectors and labour leaders. During the year, President Kaunda agreed to a referendum on the one-party state but, in the face of continued opposition, dropped the referendum and signed a [[constitutional amendment]] making Zambia a multi-party state. Zambia's first multi-party elections for parliament and the presidency since the 1960s were held on 31 October 1991. MMD candidate [[Frederick Chiluba]] resoundingly carried the presidential election over Kenneth Kaunda with 76% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/zambia-1991-presidential-election-national-results |title=Zambia: 1991 Presidential election national results &#124; EISA |access-date=2014-07-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210407/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/zambia-1991-presidential-election-national-results |archive-date=2014-07-14 }}</ref> To add to the MMD landslide, in the [[parliamentary election]]s the MMD won 125 of the 150 elected seats and UNIP the remaining 25. However, UNIP swept the Eastern Province, gathering 19 of its seats there.

===1991–2001: MMD and Frederick Chiluba===
By the end of Chiluba's first term as president (1996), the MMD's commitment to political reform had faded in the face of re-election demands. A number of prominent supporters founded opposing parties. Relying on the MMD's overwhelming majority in parliament, President Chiluba in May 1996 pushed through constitutional amendments that eliminated former President Kaunda and other prominent opposition leaders from the [[Zambian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential elections]].

In the presidential and parliamentary elections held in November 1996, Chiluba was re-elected, and the MMD won 131 of the 150 seats in the National Assembly. Kaunda's UNIP party [[boycott]]ed the parliamentary polls to protest the exclusion of its leader from the presidential race, alleging in addition that the outcome of the election had been predetermined due to a faulty voter registration exercise. Despite the UNIP boycott, the elections took place peacefully, and five presidential and more than 600 parliamentary candidates from 11 parties participated. Afterward, however, several opposition parties and [[non-governmental organisation]]s declared the elections neither free nor fair. As President Chiluba began his second term in 1997, the opposition continued to reject the results of the election amid international efforts to encourage the MMD and the opposition to resolve their differences through dialogue.

Early in 2001, supporters of President Chiluba mounted a campaign to amend the constitution to enable Chiluba to seek a third term of office. Civil society, opposition parties, and many members of the ruling party complimented widespread popular opposition to exert sufficient pressure on Chiluba to force him to back away from any attempt at a third term.

Presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections were held on 27 December 2001. Eleven parties contested the elections. The elections encountered numerous administrative problems. Opposition parties alleged that serious irregularities occurred. Nevertheless, MMD presidential candidate [[Levy Mwanawasa]] was declared the victor by a narrow margin, and he was sworn into office on 2 January 2002. Three parties submitted petitions to the High Court, challenging the presidential election results. The courts decided that there had been irregularities but that they were not serious enough to have affected the overall result, thus the election result was upheld. Opposition parties won a majority of parliamentary seats in the December, 2001 election, but subsequent by-elections gave the ruling MMD a slim majority in Parliament.

===2001–2008===
In the [[Zambian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]] was hotly contested, with Mwanawasa being re-elected by a clear margin over principal challengers [[Michael Sata]] of the [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] and [[Hakainde Hichilema]] of the [[United Party for National Development]] (UPND).

The parliamentary election that same year awarded MMD with 72 seats, the remaining 84 seats split among other parties with the majority of those seats going to the Patriotic Front.

The presidency of Levy Mwanawasa until his death in office in mid-2008, was different from the flamboyant expenditure and increasingly apparent corruption of the later years of Frederick Chiluba's terms in office. Indeed, the former president was arrested and charged with several counts of [[embezzlement]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]], firmly quashing initial fears that President Mwanawasa would [[turn a blind eye]] to the allegations of his predecessor's improprieties.

Mwanawasa was accused by some observers of demonstrating an authoritarian streak in early 2004 when his Minister of Home Affairs issued a deportation order to a British citizen and long-time Zambian resident Roy Clarke, who had published a series of satirical attacks on the president in the independent Post newspaper. However, when Clarke appealed to the High Court against the order, the judge ruled that the order was arbitrary and unjustified and quashed the order. President Mwanawasa, true to his mantra of heading a government of laws, respected the court decision and Clarke was allowed to resume his column of satirical critique. Mwanawasa's early zeal to root out corruption also waned somewhat, with key witnesses in the Chiluba trial leaving the country. The Constitutional Review Commission set up by Mwanawasa also hit some turbulence, with arguments as to where its findings should be submitted leading to suspicions that he has been trying to manipulate the outcome. Generally, the Zambian electorate viewed Mwanawasa's rule as a great improvement over Chiluba's.

Following Mwanawasa's death in August 2008, Zambian vice-president [[Rupiah Banda]] succeeded him to the office of president, to be held as a temporary position until the emergency election on 30 October 2008. Banda won by a narrow margin over opposition leader Michael Sata, to complete the remainder of Mwanawasa's term.

===2011 elections===
[[Rupiah Banda]] failed to be re-elected in the 2011 Presidential and Parliamentary elections, losing to [[Michael Sata]] of the [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]]. This brought an end to a total of 20 years' rule by three presidents from the [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy|MMD]].

===2015–present===
[[Edgar Lungu|Edgar Chagwa Lungu]] was sworn in as president of Zambia on 25 January 2015, succeeding acting-president [[Guy Scott]] who briefly held the office after the passing of Michael Chiluyfa Sata. Lungu's presidency has thus far been criticised for failing to halt the depreciating [[Zambian Kwacha|Kwacha]]. There have also been unsubstantiated reports of Lungu's alleged alcoholism, stemming from a reported physical collapse early in his presidency.<ref name=""BBC Lungu"">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31795526|title=Edgar Lungu collapse: Zambian president 'needs treatment abroad'|date=2015-03-09|work=[[BBC]]|access-date=2020-07-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828145910/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31795526|archive-date=2017-08-28|url-status=live}}</ref> The economic challenges facing Zambia, in particular the depreciating Kwacha, have been attributed to the global fall of commodity prices. Zambia derives over 90% of its export earnings from a single commodity, copper, which has lost about 45% of its value on the international commodity market.

On 5 January 2016, Lungu successfully concluded long-standing constitutional issues when he assented to the 2015 Constitutional Amendment Bill. This bill is the result of extensive work begun during the Mwanawasa era (The Mwanakatwe Commission) and continued by the Michael Chilufya Sata appointed Technical Committee. As justice minister, Lungu had previously presented the draft constitution to parliament, where it was subsequently decided that non-contentious issues will be debated in parliament and contentious issues will be subject to a referendum. In the August [[2016 Zambian general election]], President Edgar Lungu won re-election narrowly in the first round of the election. The opposition had allegations of fraud and the governing Patriotic Front (PF) rejected the allegations made by opposition UPND party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37086365|title = Zambia's President Edgar Lungu declared election winner|work = BBC News|date = 15 August 2016}}</ref> However, in 2020 the Parliament through the office of the justice minister (Given Lubinda) proposed a bill called Bill 10, which was rejected in Parliament on its third reading.

== Executive branch ==
The executive branch of the Zambian government is vested in the president who is elected in a [[Two-round system|two round system]]. Presidents serve terms of five years and are limited to two terms.

Prior to the 2016 Constitutional Amendment the Zambian vice-president was appointed by the president, but the current 2016 amendment puts the vice-president on the same electoral ticket as the president ([[running mate]]) (Article 110 Sec 2, 3 and 4) and in the event of a vacancy of an elected president the vice-president is the immediate successor to the president and remains president until the next general election (Article 106 Sec 5(a) and Sec 6).<ref>{{Cite web|url=41.77.4.167:6510/www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/amendment_act/Constitution%20of%20Zambia%20%20(Amendment),%202016-Act%20No.%202_0.pdf|title=Constitution of Zambia (Amendment)|last=National Assembly of Zambia|date=5 January 2015|website=Parliament of Zambia|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> This is in contrast to the 1996 constitution that required a by-election within 90 days of an elected president's vacancy with the vice-president acting as an interim (as was the case with former Acting-President [[Guy Scott]] in October 2014 to January 2015 and former President Rupiah Banda in 2008 after the deaths of Presidents [[Michael Sata|Sata]] and [[Levy Mwanawasa|Mwanawasa]] respectively).

The presidency is currently filled by [[Hakainde Hichilema]] with [[Mutale Nalumango]] as vice-president since [[2021 Zambian general election|2021]].

== Legislative branch ==

The [[unicameral]] '''[[National Assembly of Zambia]]''' is the country's legislative body. The current National Assembly, formed following elections held on [[2021 Zambian general election|12 August 2021]], has a total of 167 members. 156 members are directly elected in single-member [[Constituency|constituencies]] using the simple majority (or [[First-past-the-post]]) system. 8 seats are filled through [[President of Zambia|presidential]] appointment, and 3 seats are held by ex-officio members: the [[Vice-President of Zambia|Vice President]], the [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Zambia|Speaker]] and one Deputy Speaker. All members serve five-year terms.

The [[Supreme Court of Zambia|Supreme Court]] is the highest court and the court of appeal; below it are the high [[court]], magistrate's court, and local courts. A separate [[Constitutional Court of Zambia|Constitutional Court]] was established in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201603220653.html|first=James|last=Kunda|title=Zambia: Constitutional Court Judges Sworn in|journal=Times of Zambia|date=22 March 2016|access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref>

== Military ==
{{main|Zambian Defence Force}}

The Zambian Defense Force (ZDF) consists of the [[Zambian Army|army]], the [[Zambian Air Force|air force]], and the [[Zambia National Service|Zambian National Service]] (ZNS). The ZDF is designed primarily for external defence. The [[Zambia Police Service|Zambian Police force]] is not part of the defence force, it was established for internal security services and is under the ministry of home affairs.

== Foreign relations ==

Zambia is a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM), the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[African Union]] (and its predecessor the [[Organization of African Unity]] or OAU), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), and the [[COMESA|Common Market for Africa]] (COMA), which is headquartered in Lusaka.

President Kaunda was a persistent and visible advocate of change in Southern Africa, supporting liberation movements in Mozambique, Namibia, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and South Africa. Many of these organisations were based in Zambia during the 1970s and 1980s.

President Chiluba assumed a somewhat higher profile internationally in the mid- and late 1990s. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks that led to the 1994 Lusaka Protocols. Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in [[Mozambique]], [[Rwanda]], [[Angola]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] into the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994.

In 1998, Zambia took the lead in efforts to establish a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zambia was active in the Congolese peace effort after the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka in July and August 1999, although activity diminished considerably after the Joint Military Commission tasked with implementing the ceasefire relocated to [[Kinshasa]] in September 2001.

Zambia is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

===Participation in international organisations===
Zambia is a member of [[ACP (Lomé Convention)|ACP]], [[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa|COMESA]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|ECA]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], G-19, [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[MONUC]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea|UNMEE]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Confederation of Labour|WCL]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Tourism Organization|WToO]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

Despite several steps taken by the previous government in order to fight '''corruption in [[Zambia]]''', there has not been a dramatic improvement in the public perception of anti-corruption efforts over the past years. [[Corruption]] remains pervasive in the country, yet in April 2014 the Business Anti-Corruption Portal reported that the situation in Zambia is relatively better than that of other countries in the region.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

In 2007, Zambia ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, committing to address and tackle corruption on all levels. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Zambia |first=U. S.

[https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2007]

In 2024, Zambia scored 39 on a scale from 0 (""highly corrupt"") to 100 (""very clean""). When ranked by score, Zambia ranked 92nd among the 180 countries in the Index, where the country ranked first is perceived to have the most honest public sector.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The ABCs of the CPI: How the Corruption Perceptions Index is calculated |url=https://www.transparency.org/en/news/how-cpi-scores-are-calculated |date=11 February 2025 |access-date=23 February 2025 |website=Transparency.org |language=en}}</ref> For comparison with regional scores, the average score among sub-Saharan African countries {{refn|Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.|group=""Note""}} was 33.

Unnecessarily long and complicated administrative procedures are common in [[Zambia|Zambia's]] business environment, leading many companies to operate in the [[Informal economy|informal sector]]. The risk of widespread use of [[Facilitating payment|facilitation payments]] is also high due to the bureaucratic procedures for obtaining licences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zambia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|date=April 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000528/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

Political corruption is seen as the most prevalent, specifically bribery. According to the Global Corruption Barometer Africa 2019 survey by Transparency International, 18% of public service users have paid a bribe in the past twelve months. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Global Corruption Barometer - Africa 2019 |url=https://www.transparency.org/en/gcb/africa/africa-2019 |access-date=2025-03-17 |website=Transparency.org |language=en}}</ref> 

Britain, Finland, Ireland and Sweden stopped their financial aid which was $34 million to Zambia due to corruption and [[financial mismanagement]] in 2018. A year later, Britain urged Zambia to take serious measures to fight corruption to get financial assistance. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zambia-corruption-idUSKCN1VH1S7|title=Britain urges Zambia to fight corruption to unlock aid|date=2019-08-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-28|language=en}}</ref>

Zambia is potentially self-sufficient in sources of electricity, coal, [[biomass]] and [[renewable energy]]. The only energy source where the country is not [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]] is [[Petroleum|petroleum energy]]. Many of the sources of energy where the country is self-sufficient are largely unexploited.<ref name=""One"">{{cite web|date=25 May 2016 | url=https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/an-overview-of-the-energy-sector/ |title=An overview of the energy sector |access-date=21 April 2018 |newspaper=[[Zambia Daily Mail]] |first=Margaret |last=Chimase |location=Lusaka}}</ref> As of 2017, the country's electricity generating capacity stood at 1,901 megawatts.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2017-03-29|title=Zambia : Zambia's Electricity Generation Capacity Increases to 1,901MW'|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2017/03/29/zambias-electricity-generation-capacity-increases-1901mw/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-10|website=Lusaka Times|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Overview==
{{asof|2016}}, it was estimated that 28 percent of [[Zambia]]'s population had access to electricity, with 62 percent of the [[Urban area|urban population]] and 5 percent of the rural population having access. At that time, about 500,000 urban households and approximately 1.8 million rural households did not have access to electricity.<ref name=""Two"">{{cite web|url=https://www.africa-eu-renewables.org/market-information/zambia/energy-sector/ | title=Zambia: Energy Sector |access-date=21 April 2018 | date=2016 |publisher=Africa-EU-Renewables.org | author=Africa-EU-Renewables}}</ref> It is estimated that electricity demand in the country is growing at about 3 percent annually.<ref name=""Three"">{{cite web| url=http://www.zda.org.zm/?q=content/energy |

There are three power producing and distribution companies in Zambia; (a) [[ZESCO|Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited]] (ZESCO), a government-owned company (b) Lunsemfwa Hydro Power Limited and (c) Ndola Energy. [[ZESCO]], the largest of the three owns and maintains 94.7 percent (2306/2434) of installed [[hydropower]] capacity, as of 2016.<ref name=""Two""/>

==Hydroelectricity==
As of 2022, the country had {{convert|3456|MW}} of installed hydropower capacity against a peak national demand of {{convert|2300|MW}}, resulting in a surplus of 1000MW which is exported to the Central and Southern African region. Zambia has an estimated {{convert|6000|MW}} of untapped hydropower potential. Hydroelectricity constitutes 90 percent of Zambia's electricity generation pool.<ref name=""Three-and-a-bit"">{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/21/zambias-zesco-declares-1000-mw-surplus-in-power-generation-is-it-now-time-to-accelerate-ev-adoption/ |title=Zambia's ZESCO Declares 1,000 MW Surplus in Power Generation — Is It Now Time To Accelerate EV Adoption? |date=21 July 2022 |publisher=Clean Technica}}</ref> Several existing large hydro facilities are currently being upgraded. Some of the new large hydropower projects in the pipeline include the 2,400 megawatts [[Batoka Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station|Batoka Gorge]] Hydroelectric Power Station and the 1,000 megawatts Luapula Hydroelectric Power Station. Substantial untapped hydropower potential exists for small scale rural electrification projects.<ref name=""Four"">{{cite web|url=https://www.africa-eu-renewables.org/market-information/zambia/renewable-energy-potential/ |title=Zambia: Renewable source Potential |date=2016 |

==Thermal power==
There are three grid-ready [[Thermal power station|thermal power]] stations. The {{convert|50|MW}} [[heavy fuel oil]] plant owned by Ndola Energy, the six [[Gas turbine|gas turbines]] with combined capacity of  {{convert|80|MW}} owned by the [[Copperbelt Energy Corporation]] and the Maamba Coal power plant with a capacity of {{convert|300|MW}}.<ref name=""Two""/><ref name=""Three-and-a-bit""/>

Zambia has proven coal reserves of at least 80,000,000 tonnes in the country's [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Province]]. Potential reserves exist elsewhere in the county, although the size of that potential has not yet been quantified.<ref name=""One""/>

==Oil and natural gas==
Although Zambia has no proven commercial deposits of oil, the country hosts an oil refinery, the ''[[Indeni Petroleum Refinery]]'', a 24,000 [[Barrel|barrels]]-a-day facility, based in [[Ndola]], in the [[Copperbelt Province]].<ref name=""Five"">{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/glencore-vitol-bid-for-stake-in-zambia-s-sole-oil-refinery |title=Glencore, Vitol Bid for Stake in Zambia's Sole Oil Refinery |date=16 March 2018 |access-date=21 April 2018 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg LP]] |last=Taonga Clifford Mitimingi |first=and Paul Burkhardt}}</ref><ref name=""Six"">{{cite web|title=Zambia Short-Lists Five Firms For Majority Stake In Oil Refinery |date=16 April 2018 |access-date=21 April 2018 | url=https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/zambia_shortlists_five_firms_for_majority_stake_in_oil_refinery-16-apr-2018-154264-article/ |publisher=Rigzone.com Quoting [[Reuters]] |last=Chris Mfula | first=and James Macharia}}</ref>

==Renewable energy==
Zambia has a diversity of potential sources of renewable energy, such as its abundant water resources for hydropower generation. Renewable energy development in the country is supported by a renewable energy strategy and a national climate change response strategy that promote low emissions, as well as the implementation of [[sustainable land management]] practices.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/988zambia.pdf|title=National Report—Zambia: The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Hydropower accounts for 85 percent of the country's total installed capacity, while there is a potential to increase production from wind and photovoltaic energy systems.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-09|title=Discussing climate change and renewable energy in Zambia|url=https://energycentral.com/c/enelfoundation/discussing-climate-change-and-renewable-energy-zambia|access-date=2021-01-10|website=Energy Central|language=en}}</ref>

As of April 2016, the peak electricity demand outstripped peak energy production by 560 megawatts. The government, ZESCO, [[civil society]] and other stakeholders are exploring opportunities in the
solar, wind, and [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] spaces to meet the deficit and to plan for future energy needs.<ref name=""Seven"">{{cite web| url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/04/27/renewable-energy-solution-zambias-energy-deficit/ |title=Is renewable energy a solution to Zambia's energy deficit? |date=27 April 2016 | newspaper=[[Lusaka Times]] |first=Melony |last=Chisanga | location=Lusaka |access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref>

'''First Lady of Zambia''' is the title attributed to the wife of the [[president of Zambia]]. Zambia's current [[First Lady|first lady]] is [[Mutinta Hichilema]], who has held the office since 24 August 2021.

The first lady of Zambia plays the ceremonial role of the spouse of the head of state, but has often expanded their influence beyond that. For example, the wife of the country's founding president, [[Betty Kaunda]], was viewed as the mother of the nation and known as ""Mama Kaunda.""<ref>{{cite news|author=James Butty, VOA staff writer |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/zambia-former-first-lady-kaunda-dead/1511410.html |title=Zambians Mourn Death of Former First Lady Betty Kaunda |publisher=VOA  |date=September 20, 2012 |access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> [[Maureen Mwanawasa]] used her platform as First Lady to be a strong advocate for safer sex for women, often handing out condoms at public events.<ref>{{cite news|author=Violet Mengo, writer for the Daily Mail in Zambia and member of the Gender and Media Southern African (GEMSA) Network. |url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/27133 |title=Zambian First Lady urges women to demand safe sex |publisher=AFROL News  |date=November 5, 2005 |access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref>

However, the ''Zambia 2012 Human Rights Report'' of the [[United States Department of State]] (one of the [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]]) noted that in general, the government's [[human rights]] record remained poor.<ref name=""USDOS-2012-HumanRightsReportforZambia""/> The 2021 version of this report noted improvements in many areas.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/zambia/ ]</ref>

==Serious abuses==

The ''Zambia 2012 Human Rights Report'' of the US State Department noted the following serious human rights abuses:<ref name=""USDOS-2012-HumanRightsReportforZambia"">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=204181 ""Zambia 2012 Human Rights Report""], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013.

== Freedom of the press ==
{{Main|Press freedom in Zambia}}

Freedoms of expression and of the press are constitutionally guaranteed in Zambia, but the government frequently restricts these rights in practice.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldaudit.org/presstable.html|title=Press Freedom survey on 186 countries|website=www.worldaudit.org|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref> Although the ruling Patriotic Front has pledged to free state-owned media—consisting of the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC) and the widely circulated ''[[Zambia Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Times of Zambia]]''—from government editorial control, these outlets have generally continued to report along pro-government lines. Many journalists reportedly practice self-censorship since most government newspapers do have prepublication review.<ref name="":0"" /> The ZNBC dominates the broadcast media, though several private stations have the capacity to reach large portions of the population.

The rights group [[Freedom House]], which publishes annual country reports on press freedom status, has ranked Zambia’s press as “Not Free” even in 2016.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/zambia|title=Zambia {{!}} Country report {{!}} Freedom of the Press {{!}} 2016|website=freedomhouse.org|access-date=2017-01-14|archive-date=2017-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116155841/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/zambia|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Formerly a colony of the [[British Empire]], Zambia inherited the laws and legal system of its colonial occupiers upon independence in 1964. Laws concerning homosexuality have largely remained unchanged since then, and homosexuality is covered by [[sodomy law]]s that also proscribe [[bestiality]].<ref name=""Numwa""/> Social attitudes toward LGBTQ people are mostly negative and coloured by perceptions that homosexuality is immoral and a form of [[insanity]].<ref name=""Numwa""/> However, in recent years, younger generations are beginning to show slightly more positive and open minded attitudes towards their LGBTQ peers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harrisberg |first=Kim |title=In Data: What do young Africans say about LGBTQ+ rights? |url=https://www.context.news/socioeconomic-inclusion/in-data-what-do-young-africans-say-about-lgbtq-rights}}</ref> 

LGBTQ persons are subjected to human rights violations by police and authorities. Subject to arbitrary arrest and detentions, they suffer violence and abuse in custody. Police are reported to threaten and extort LGBTQ persons. Those prosecuted for same-sex conduct are subjected to the use of forced anal examinations for evidence-gathering purposes. Such procedures are invasive and traumatic and are widely condemned by medical authorities and human rights groups; they are discredited for the purpose of providing any evidence of same-sex sexual activity. 

Other serious societal discrimination and abuse is directed towards LGBTQ persons. They may be targeted threats, [[stalking]], [[vandalism]], [[violence]], and other [[hate crimes]], including [[murder]]s. LGBTQ people routinely face community harassment and discrimination, with little recourse to assistance from police or government.

In recent years, the onset of the internet has led to more positive support and opinions towards the LGBTQ community. The fast digitization of the country has led to exposure to more people and stories from different facets of life. This in turn has led to more open minded attitudes amongst the growing youth reducing discrimination and prejudice among people of different communities.

==Laws==
Same-sex sexual activity is proscribed by Sections 155 and 156 of Zambia's penal code (as amended 1933 and repealed and replaced by Act No. 15 of 2005).{{efn|group=ua|name=""ss157-158""}} The law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual conduct, with penalties upon conviction for engaging in ""acts against the order of nature"" of fifteen years' to life imprisonment. Convictions under the lesser charge of ""gross indecency"" carries a penalty of up to fourteen years' imprisonment.<ref name=""ILGA 2020"">{{cite report |author1=ILGA |title=State-Sponsored Homophobia - 2020 global legislation overview update|page=125 |url=https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_World_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_report_global_legislation_overview_update_December_2020.pdf  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201215114401/https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_World_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_report_global_legislation_overview_update_December_2020.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2020|url-status=live|access-date=13 June 2022 |language=en |date=December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Include-USGov

As many East and Southern African former British colonies have done, Zambia enacted its own constitution in the 1990s. This overrides much of the pre-1964 criminal code, and there are very broad protections against discrimination, with much of the language lifted from the UN Charter on Human Rights.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/HRPN_English.pdf |title=Human Rights in UNDP: Practice Note|date=April 2005 |access-date=2011-10-25|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611114353/http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/HRPN_English.pdf |archive-date=11 June 2007}}</ref>

{{quote|23. [Protection from discrimination on the ground of race,etc.]
# Subject to clauses (4), (5) and (7), no law shall make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself or in its effect.
# Subject to clauses (6), (7) and (8), no person shall be treated in a discriminatory manner by any person acting by virtue of any written law or in the performance of the functions of any public office or any public authority.
# In this Article the expression ""discriminatory"" mean, affording different treatment to different persons attributable, wholly or mainly to their respective descriptions by race, tribe, sex, place of origin, marital status, political opinions colour or creed whereby persons of one such description are subjected to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of another such description are not made subject or are accorded privileges or advantages which are not accorded to persons of another such description.}}

It can be argued that homosexuality is constitutionally protected under Article 23 of the 1996 Constitution. As [[constitution]]s override other laws, this may be why few, if any, prosecutions for homosexuality have taken place, as this would allow the relevant Criminal Code sections to be tested, and deleted if they are found to contravene the Constitution.

The Constitution of 1991, as amended by Act no. 17 of 1996, contains an [[anti-discrimination law|anti-discrimination clause]], present in Article 23 of the document. According to Article 23(1), ""no law shall make any provision that is discriminatory either of itself or in its effect"". Article 23(2) further prohibits discrimination ""by any person acting by virtue of any written law or in the performance of the functions of any public office or any public authority"", and Article 23(3) defines discrimination as extending to differential treatment of persons on the basis of ""race, tribe, sex, place of origin, marital status, political opinions, color or creed"". There is implicit but no explicit legal protection against [[discrimination]] based on [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] in the Zambian Constitution. <ref name=""Fabeni""/>

== Legal action and reform ==
Although Zambia has maintained a strict stance against any form of LGBTQ activity, there have been a number of efforts by the UN to get Zambia to change its policies and law regarding same-sex activity. These efforts have been largely in vain as Zambia sustained its policies.

Zambian legal policies regarding same-sex activity have effectively bred a national environment of homophobia which has made it to where that the justice system severely disadvantages LGBTQ identifying individuals. The justice system fails to recognize and protect the lives of LGBTQ citizens which has in effect opened the window for citizen-based militia activity against LGBTQ individuals. The US Department of State's 2010 report on human rights in Zambia states that:<ref name=""2010 US State""/>{{bq|...the government enforces law that criminalizes homosexual conduct and did not respond to societal discrimination{{nbsp}}... according to LGBT advocacy groups, societal violence occurred, as did societal discrimination in employment, housing, and access to education or health care{{nbsp}}... LGBT groups reported frequent attacks and discrimination in the neighborhoods in which they operated. Activists reported regular harassment, including threats via text message and e-mail, vandalism, stalking, and outright violence.}} In April 2013, [[Paul Kasonkomona]], a notable Zambian LGBTQ activist, was arrested for speaking about LBGT and HIV related issues on a local TV station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/2015/05/15/news-release-zambia-high-court-confirms-acquittal-of-hiv-activist-paul-kasonkomona/|title=NEWS RELEASE: ZAMBIA HIGH COURT CONFIRMS ACQUITTAL OF HIV ACTIVIST, PAUL KASONKOMONA – Southern Africa Litigation Centre|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-03-26|archive-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220141821/https://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/2015/05/15/news-release-zambia-high-court-confirms-acquittal-of-hiv-activist-paul-kasonkomona/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kasonkomona was charged with the crime of ""soliciting in a public place for immoral purpose."" Also in 2013, two gay-identifying men were beaten outside of a nightclub after being found in a ""compromising position"". They decided against pressing charges out of the fear of being jailed themselves.

In May 2014, citizens of the Marapodi area of [[Lusaka]] apprehended two women who were suspected lesbians. They captured the women, brought them to the local police station, and demanded their arrest.<ref>{{cite report |author1=((Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor)) |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015: Zambia |url=http://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2015&dlid=252743|access-date=2020-03-26 |website=US Department of State |date=2016}}</ref>

In January 2015, an openly gay man was attacked by a mob which reportedly included three police officers.<ref name=""76 crimes 2014"">{{cite web |title=Zambia's growing intolerance towards LGBTI persons|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26 |url=https://76crimes.com/2014/01/31/zambias-growing-intolerance-towards-lgbti-persons/ |website=Erasing 76 Crimes |date=31 January 2014}}</ref>

Zambia has abstained from/denied a number of reform efforts. In 2011, Zambia was one of three countries to abstain from a call from the Human Rights Council to prepare a report on the rights of its LGBTQ citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/RES/17/19|title=Human Rights Documents|website=ap.ohchr.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> In a 2012 UPR review, Zambia rejected recommendations to repeal laws criminalizing same-sex relations. This followed a similar recommendation by the UPR in its 2008 review. The Zambian delegation provided the following in defense of their rejections:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/100/05/PDF/G1310005.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|website=documents-dds-ny.un.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref><blockquote>the Constitution making process will give the people the opportunity to determine whether specific rights for LGBTQ persons should be enshrined in the Constitution. The Government was determined not to prescribe to the Zambian people those rights that the Constitution should contain, but to let them make such a determination.</blockquote>However, in its 2018 review, Zambia noted the recommendations to decriminalize same-sex relations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G18/005/26/PDF/G1800526.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|website=documents-dds-ny.un.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Aside from this, no further actions have been made thus far.

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Zambia}}

===Community attitudes===
Zambia's societal attitudes towards homosexuality strongly reflect the influences of evangelical religions and historical colonial attitudes to homosexuality. Arguably the largest recipient of [[fundamentalist]] [[evangelical]] missionaries during [[Northern Rhodesia|British colonial times]], such fundamentalist-style religious adherence is widespread in Zambia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/evangelicalempire.htm |title=Jerusalem Lost — The Evangelical Empire: Christianity's contribution to Victorian Colonial Expansion |last=Carr |first=Robert |editor=Stephen Luscombe |website=British Empire |access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=College of Charleston|title=Student term paper|url=http://kebrowne.stu.cofc.edu/history273-_term_paper.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819082404/http://kebrowne.stu.cofc.edu/history273-_term_paper.html |archive-date=19 August 2011}}{{better source needed|date=June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmausa.org/page.aspx?id=163219 |title=History of Protestant Missions in Zimbabwe |publisher=Wmausa.org |access-date=11 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307223025/http://www.wmausa.org/page.aspx?id=163219 |archive-date=7 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jd-elliott.net/Christianity.html |title=Christianity |publisher=Jd-elliott.net |access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref>

===Harassment and violence===
According to a report submitted to the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] by [[Global Rights]] and the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]], the criminalization of consensual homosexual sex in Zambia ""has a devastating impact on same-sex practicing people in Zambia"". The report asserts that LGBTQ people are subject to [[arbitrary arrest and detention]], ""discrimination in education, employment, housing, and access to services"", and [[extortion]]–often with the knowledge or participation of law enforcement authorities.<ref name=""Fabeni""/> The [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2021 ''Human Rights Practices Report'' for Zambia concurs, stating:<ref name=""2021-22 US State"">{{multiref2|1={{cite report |author1=((Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor)) |title=2021 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Zambia |chapter-url=https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/zambia/|date=2021 |publisher=United States Department of State |chapter=Section 6.

The report notes that LGBTQI+ advocacy groups advise that police regularly solicit bribes from arrested individuals for alleged same-sex activity. 

The research and advocacy group [[Human Rights Watch]] reports the use of forced anal examinations for police prosecutions, despite such procedures having no evidentiary value as to same-sex activity.

'''Mulungushi Rock of Authority''', also known as '''Mulungushi Rock''', is a [[Inselberg|kopje]] (isolated rock hill) in the [[Central Province, Zambia|Central Province]] of [[Zambia]] associated with major political gatherings and speeches. Situated near the [[Mulungushi River]] north of [[Kabwe]], it was first used in 1958 for a rally of the [[Zambian African National Congress]] and then in 1960 for the first conference of the newly-formed [[United National Independence Party]]. Since 1964, it has been regularly used by political parties for their annual conventions and meetings. A national symbol, the Rock of Authority is called ""the birthplace of Zambian independence"".<ref name=syn>{{cite web |url=https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/mulungushi-synonymous-zambias-independence-story/|title=Mulungushi: Synonymous with Zambia's independence story|first=Carlos|last=Bunda|date=2 October 2014|access-date=31 October 2017|work=[[Zambia Daily Mail]]}}</ref>

==History==
Mulungushi Rock was first used for an October 26, 1958 rally of the [[Zambian African National Congress]] (ZANC) under the leadership of [[Kenneth Kaunda]].{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2010|p=177}} When Kaunda and other nationalists broke away from the ZANC and launched their own political party, the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP), in 1960, they chose the isolated site to hold their first party conference where it would not draw the attention of the [[North Rhodesia]]n authorities.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2010|pp=56–57}} The area was centrally located, however, enabling more participants to come from all parts of the country.<ref name=syn/> Situated near the [[Mulungushi River]] approximately {{convert|10|km}} north of [[Kabwe|Broken Hill]] (later renamed [[Kabwe]]), the Rock could accommodate up to 2,000 people for outdoor speeches and for lodging in temporary shelters.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2010|pp=56–57, 181}} The river guaranteed a water source for large crowds, as did a small [[dambo]] flowing from the north.{{sfn|Zulu|2007|p=202}} The conference organizers received a permit to use the land but were not allowed to cut down trees or gather wood for fires; they were required to purchase wood from the Mpima Forestry Offices {{convert|50|km}} distant.{{sfn|Zulu|2007|p=201}}
[[File:Meeting place near the Mulungushi Rock of Authority.jpg|thumb|Meeting place near the Mulungushi Rock of Authority, on the campus of Mulungushi University (Great North Road Campus)]]

More than 2,000 people attended that 1960 conference,<ref name=syn/> which put the UNIP on the political map and helped it become the primary party in the Zambian independence movement.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2010|p=57}} Joseph Katampi, party secretary from the [[Mkushi]] constituency, recalled in 2014:
<blockquote>""When we gathered at Mulungushi Rock, we resolved to take any course of action by using any means to indicate our seriousness about independence to the white government ... we resolved not to compromise with the British government's interest of giving us the [[Iain Macleod|Macleod]] constitution but a constitution that allowed for [[one man, one vote]]"".<ref name=syn/></blockquote>

After Zambia achieved independence in 1964, the UNIP staged its annual conference and other meetings at Mulungushi Rock,<ref name=syn/> including the 1967 council meeting noted for [[Simon Kapwepwe]]'s announcing his candidacy for vice-president of the party and Kaunda resigning from the party presidency for a few hours.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2010|pp=181–182}} The UNIP also used the site for major policy addresses, such as the Mulungushi Reforms of 1968 and a major land policy reform in 1975.{{sfn|Mwakikagile|2010|pp=181–182}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanlandmark.org.za/conference/2010_papers/05.pdf|title= Customary land reform to facilitate private investment in Zambia: achievements, potentials and limitations|first=Austine |last=Ng'ombe|year=2010|page=3|publisher=Urban Landmark|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref> According to O'Sullivan, the site began to be called the Rock of Authority ""with the party's decisions handed down with quasi-divine authority as from an oracle"".{{sfn|O'Sullivan|1997|p=22}}
[[File:Chalets near the Mulungushi Rock of Authority.jpg|thumb|Chalets near the Mulungushi Rock of Authority, on the campus of Mulungushi University (Great North Road Campus)]]

The Rock of Authority went on to become the venue for many other political events, including conventions of the [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]]{{sfn|Mbikusita-Lewanika|2005|p=vii}} and the [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lusakatimes.com/2014/11/30/delegates-mulungushi-rock-authority-resort-prayers/|title= Delegates at Mulungushi Rock of Authority resort to prayers|date=30 November 2014|access-date=31 October 2017|work=[[Lusaka Times]]}}</ref> Labour groups also conduct conferences here.<ref name=syn/> Since 2009, [[Mulungushi University]] has held its annual graduation ceremony at the Rock of Authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://allevents.in/events/mulungushi-university-9th-graduation-ceremony/169937126917168|title= Mulungushi University, 9th Graduation Ceremony|publisher=All Events in City|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref>

Although the Rock is often said to be located in Kabwe, it is in fact located outside that city. In 1994 the Rock was incorporated into the [[Kapiri Mposhi District]], as was nearby Mulungushi University. The Mulungushi River serves as the boundary between Kabwe and the Kapiri Mposhi District.<ref name=mail/>

==Nearby facilities==
In 1972 the UNIP founded an institute for labour studies, the President's Citizens College, near the Rock of Authority.<ref name=mail>{{cite web |url= https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/setting-record-straight-mulungushi-rock-authority-kapiri/|title=Setting record straight: Mulungushi Rock of Authority is in Kapiri|work=Zambia Daily Mail|date=16 March 2015|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref>

A branch of [[Mulungushi University]] was established a few kilometres away in January 2008. The university erected a commercial centre to accommodate groups indoors; most political conventions are now held there.<ref name=low>{{cite web |url=http://www.lowdownzambia.com/2012/10/30/steady-as-a-rock|title=Steady As a Rock|work=The Lowdown|date=30 October 2012|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref> The centre includes a conference room with capacity for 1,000 attendees, 21 [[chalet]]-style apartments, and a restaurant.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mu.ac.zm/index.php/component/content/category/128-service-departments|title=Commercial Centre|publisher=[[Mulungushi University]]|access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref>

{{Politics of Zambia}}
The '''National Assembly''' is [[Zambia]]'s [[unicameral]] legislative body. Between 1972 and 1990, Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) as the sole legal party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mushingeh|first=Chiponde|title=Unrepresentative 'democracy': One-Party Rule in Zambia, 1973-1990|date=1994|journal=Transafrican Journal of History|volume=23|pages=117–141|jstor=24520273|issn=0251-0391}}</ref>

The current National Assembly, formed following elections held in 2021, has a total of 166 members. 156 members are directly elected in single-member [[Constituency|constituencies]] using the simple plurality (or [[first-past-the-post]]) system. Eight additional seats are filled through [[President of Zambia|presidential]] appointment. The Speaker, first deputy speaker and the [[Vice President of Zambia|Vice President]] are also granted a seat in the assembly.

==Electoral system==
Of the 167 members of the National Assembly, 156 are elected by the first-past-the-post system in single-member constituencies, with a further eight appointed by the President and three others being ''ex-officio'' members: the Vice President, the Speaker and one deputy speakers (one elected from outside the National Assembly, while another is chosen among the elected members of the house).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elections: Zambia President 2015|url=https://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2814/|access-date=2021-02-14|website=IFES Election Guide}}</ref> The minimum voting age is 18, whilst National Assembly candidates must be at least 21.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ZAMBIA (National Assembly), Electoral system|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2359_B.htm|access-date=2021-02-14|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union}}</ref>

== Location ==
At the time of Zambia's independence in 1964, the National Assembly was housed in inadequate and unsuitable premises behind the Government's Central Offices in Lusaka, commonly known as the ""Secretariat Area"". It was, therefore, apparent at the time of independence that a more fitting building should be constructed to meet future expansion and also to provide adequate members’ sitting and office accommodations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Assembly|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/111|date=2020-05-27|website=National Assembly|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

A site was chosen on the crown of a low hill in Lusaka, which dominated the surrounding landscape of the city. The site was also, at one time, the site of the dwelling place of the village headman, Lusaka, after whom the city is now named.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Assembly|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/111|date=2020-05-27|website=National Assembly|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

The new National Assembly building was planned so that its external appearance expressed the dignity and power of the Government, while internally, it is planned to function as a centre of administration. The focal point of the building is the Chamber, which is rich in decoration and colour, in contrast to the rest of the building.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Assembly of Zambia|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/111|date=2020-05-27|website=National Assembly of Zambia|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

Abortion in Zambia,"{{Short description|none}}
{{good article}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2024}}
{{EngvarB|date=July 2024}} <!--Use Zambian English-->

In [[Zambia]], [[abortion]] is [[Abortion law|legal]] if the pregnancy would threaten the mother's [[Maternal death|life]] or [[Complications of pregnancy|physical or mental health]] or those of existing children, or if it would cause a [[birth defect]]. Zambia has one of the most permissive [[Abortion in Africa|abortion laws in Africa]], though its restrictions limit access. The Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Act, passed in 1972, legalizes abortion if approved by medical professionals. It requires signatures from three doctors, including one specialist. Amendments to the bill and medical guidelines clarify that the law allows the consideration of situations such as [[pregnancy from rape]], as well as [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic factors]].

Legal abortions are available but often expensive or difficult to access. Some critics of Zambia's abortion law believe that the TOP Act's restrictions are barriers to access for most Zambians. Other critics believe that the country provides for abortions in law but not in practice. The majority of women in Zambia do not know about the abortion law, and many healthcare providers do not know its terms. [[Conscientious objection to abortion]] by medical providers is common. Public providers provide abortions for free, but unofficial costs are often high. Most abortions are performed unsafely by illegal practitioners. Abortion complications commonly occur. Unsafe abortions cause 30% of [[maternal death]]s. Public health providers legally do not charge money for abortions, but unofficial fees are common. Many women cannot afford safe surgical abortions. Medical abortions are widespread in cities. Rural areas have low access to abortion. Adolescents are likely to have unsafe abortions.

Abortion is stigmatised in Zambia. A majority of Zambians believe abortion should be illegal. Zambia's [[state religion]] is Christianity, and churches are influential in [[Christianity and abortion|opposing abortion on religious grounds]]. [[Abortion-rights movements|Supporters of abortion]] believe legal abortion is a solution to public health issues.

== Legislation ==
The Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Act law legalizes abortion if the pregnancy increases the risk of death or physical or mental health issues for the mother or any existing children, or if it would result in a [[birth defect]]. The mother's age and environment in the present or near future may be considered. An abortion must be approved by three medical professionals, including one specialist. This requirement may be waived if one doctor believes it is an emergency.<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> It must be performed in a registered location by a registered practitioner, with the woman's informed consent. Performing or receiving an illegal abortion is punishable by seven years of prison.<ref name=""Katongo"" /> The law allows medical professionals to [[Conscientious objection to abortion|object to performing an abortion]], except in emergencies. The sentence is seven years for illegally providing an abortion and fourteen years for illegally obtaining or assisting in an abortion.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

In May 2009, the [[Ministry of Health (Zambia)|Ministry of Health]] (MOH) wrote a set of guidelines on how to determine whether a pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's health, based on objective and subjective socioeconomic factors. The guidelines allow health providers to perform an abortion based on these factors with the woman's consent and permit mid-level providers to provide abortions in the [[Pregnancy#Trimesters|first trimester]].<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> The guidelines say that clients must be referred to providers willing to assist with abortion, that most government healthcare facilities must ensure access to abortion, and that conscientious objection only applies to individual doctors providing abortion itself.<ref name=""Freeman & Coast"" /> The TOP Act does not specify a gestational limit, but the MOH has regulated that abortion is banned after [[fetal viability]], at 28 weeks.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

Zambia  has one of the region's most liberal abortion laws.<ref name=""Katongo"" /> It is [[Abortion in Africa|one of the only countries in Africa]] to allow abortions for socioeconomic reasons.<ref name=""CFR"">{{Cite news |author=<!--Women and Foreign Policy Program Staff--> |date=7 March 2024 |title=Abortion Law: Global Comparisons |url=https://www.cfr.org/article/abortion-law-global-comparisons |access-date=12 July 2024 |work=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]}}</ref> Its law complies with Article 14(2)(c) of the [[Maputo Protocol]], which it has ratified.<ref name=""Kangaude et al"" /> However, its legislation has been called a ""paper law"".<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"">{{Cite journal |last1=Fetters |first1=Tamara |last2=Samandari |first2=Ghazaleh |last3=Djemo |first3=Patrick |last4=Vwallika |first4=Bellington |last5=Mupeta |first5=Stephen |date=16 February 2017 |title=Moving from legality to reality: how medical abortion methods were introduced with implementation science in Zambia |journal=[[Reproductive Health (journal)|Reproductive Health]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=26 |doi=10.1186/s12978-017-0289-2 |pmc=5314585 |pmid=28209173 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The law is open to interpretation and its restrictions make abortion difficult.

Global abortion supporters present Zambia as an example of permissive legislation, but the consensus in Zambia is ambiguous. Some abortion supporters say the TOP Act is restrictive as the requirements for legal abortion limit access; others say the law is liberal but the actual situation must change to represent this.

== History ==
Before 1972, the [[penal code of Zambia]] criminalized abortion. In 1972, the TOP Act was proposed to the [[National Assembly of Zambia]]. It was drafted based on the United Kingdom's [[Abortion Act 1967]]. It was passed eight years into the presidency of [[Kenneth Kaunda]], whose [[Zambian Humanism]] ideology involved [[Christian right|conservative Christian]], patriarchal views on female sexuality. The Minister of Health presented it to the parliament, saying, ""the purpose of this Bill is to amend and clarify the law relating to termination of pregnancy by registered medical practitioners"". He argued that clarifying the law would remove doubts among medical practitioners and prevent deaths. His closing remarks said the law did ""not open the flood-gates for termination of pregnancy upon demand"". Opposing MPs argued that it would increase the number of abortions. The bill passed by 66 to 13 votes. The [[Catholic Church in Zambia]] wrote to the Secretary General to the Cabinet to protest the bill, claiming that it had been passed too quickly, without public debate, and was based on a British law. The Speaker of the Parliament wrote to Kaunda to clarify that the bill would not legalize abortion on demand, writing, ""the Bill itself is meant to serve two to five people in twenty years or so"". Kaunda signed the bill into law.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

The passing of the TOP Act was not followed by technical guidance for implementation.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" /> The act was amended in 1994.<ref name=""Katongo"" /> A 2005 amendment specified that abortion is allowed in the case of [[Child sexual abuse|child rape]].<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" />

[[Dilation and curettage]] was the standard method of abortion until the 2000s, despite the [[World Health Organization]]'s recommendation of manual [[vacuum aspiration]] (MVA).<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" /> In 1988, [[University Teaching Hospital]] (UTH) and the international NGO [[Ipas (organization)|Ipas]] began a successful project to increace the hospital's capacity for abortions and introduce MVA.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=Jan |last2=Sikazwe |first2=Nsama |last3=Healy |first3=Joan |date=November–December 1991 |title=Improving Abortion Care in Zambia |jstor=1966453 |journal=[[Studies in Family Planning]] |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=391–394 |doi=10.2307/1966453 |pmid=1792679 }}</ref> In the early 1990s, NGOs supported by [[USAID]] introduced a training program, but its resource and infrastructure requirements received insufficient government support amid the [[HIV/AIDS in Zambia|AIDS epidemic]]. UTH was the only abortion facility. In 1992, the government reformed its health system to be decentralized and include an ""essential package"" of services, including MVA. This reform occurred during the peak of the Zambian AIDS epidemic, which weakened the healthcare system too much for other initiatives.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

In 2008, the MOH began a national assessment of unsafe abortion with the goal of reducing maternal mortality and meeting the U.N. [[Millennium Development Goals]]. It formed a team of legislators and representatives of the WHO and Ipas. It recommended expanding medical abortion, training mid-level providers in surgical abortion to increase access in rural areas, and drafting guidelines. Beginning in August 2009, the MOH collaborated with Ipas and UTH on a pilot project to introduce medical abortions to hospitals. It planned to implement comprehensive abortion care in 7 hospitals and 21 primary health facilities across Lusaka and [[Copperbelt Province]]. The team trained, supervised, and supplied equipment to 128 providers. In the second phase, it helped pharmacists access updated abortion drugs. It performed outreach in collaboration with the [[Planned Parenthood]] Association of Zambia and seven community-based organizations. The project lasted two years and led to 25 of the 28 facilities providing comprehensive abortion care. The others were unwilling to perform abortion services.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

The MOH's program led to an increase in providers' support for abortion and confidence in performing it. Most of the providers and pharmacists who participated agreed that they should support abortions.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" /> After [[misoprostol]] and [[mifepristone]] became available in the 25 facilities, pharmacists became more aware of these pills and more likely to provide access or information. At the time, misoprostol was widely known as an abortifacient, but over-the-counter drugs derived from it were only approved for other purposes. The misoprostol drug Cytotec was imported and was known as ""the Chinese pill"".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hendrickson |first1=Cheryl |last2=Fetters |first2=Tamara |last3=Mupeta |first3=Stephen |last4=Vwallika |first4=Bellington |last5=Djemo |first5=Patrick |last6=Raisanen |first6=Keris |date=23 October 2015 |title=Client–pharmacy worker interactions regarding medical abortion in Zambia in 2009 and 2011 |journal=[[International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics]] |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=214–218 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.07.008 |pmid=26604158 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In July 2010, mifepristone was first imported for limited use in public facilities.

Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Zambia]] protects [[fetal rights]], saying ""A person shall not deprive an unborn child of life by termination of pregnancy except in accordance with the conditions laid down by an Act of Parliament for that purpose"". In 2015, a draft for Article 28 was proposed that would say ""Every person has a right to life, which begins at conception"".<ref name=""Ngosa"">{{Cite news |last=Ngosa |first=Stanslous |date=31 March 2015 |title=Women remain in dark on abortion law |url=https://www.times.co.zm/?p=54554 |access-date=12 July 2024 |work=[[Times of Zambia]]}}</ref> The amendment was deferred for being ""contentious"" and was not included in the Constitution of Zambia Amendment Bill of 2015.<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> It was sent to a referendum that failed due to low turnout.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

Zambian nonprofits receive funding from Western nations to conduct legal abortions. After the United States [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization|overturned its right to abortion]], their leaders were concerned it would threaten their funding.<ref>{{Cite news |author=<!--Times Reporter--> |date=21 July 2022 |title=Will US ruling on safe abortion affect Zambia? |url=https://www.times.co.zm/?p=118193 |access-date=12 July 2024 |work=[[Times of Zambia]]}}</ref>

== Prevalence ==
In 2015–2019, Zambia had an annual average of 140,000 abortions. The share of unintended pregnancies resulting in abortion was 28%, up from 19% in 1990–2004.<ref>{{Cite web |author=<!--not stated--> |date=2022 |title=Zambia country profile |url=https://www.guttmacher.org/regions/africa/zambia |access-date=12 July 2024 |website=[[Guttmacher Institute]]}}</ref> Between 2009 and 2011, the annual number of cases of abortion did not increase, but the proportion of safe, legal abortions increased from 3.2% to 7.7%.<ref name=""Leone et al"" />

A 2010 survey found that most people consider [[self-induced abortions]] or traditional healers to perform abortions, only considering public health facilities if such procedures went wrong.<ref name=""Cresswell et al"" /> Both clients and providers view medical abortion as more acceptable than surgical abortion.<ref name=""Fetters et al 17"" />

=== Legal abortions ===
The law requires abortions to be performed by registered medical practitioners rather than nurses. As of 2018, Zambia has one doctor per 12,000 people, making access difficult, especially in rural areas.<ref name=""CFR"" /> The law requires a signature from a specialist within a field relevant to the abortion, which further restricts access.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> Activists have argued that the requirement is unrealistic and has not resulted in access to safe abortions.<ref name=""Katongo"" /><ref name=""Ngosa"" />

As of 2013, 88 public facilities provide abortions.<ref name=""Parmar et al"" /> Abortion facilities are concentrated in [[Lusaka]]; the largest provider of abortions is the UTH.<ref name=""Freeman et al"" /> Public providers must provide abortions for no cost besides a registration fee, while private providers charge money.<ref name=""Leone et al"" /><ref name=""Parmar et al"">{{Cite journal |last1=Parmar |first1=Divya |last2=Leone |first2=Tiziana |last3=Coast |first3=Ernestina |last4=Murray |first4=Susan Fairley |last5=Hukin |first5=Eleanor |last6=Vwalika |first6=Bellington |date=27 September 2015 |title=Cost of abortions in Zambia: A comparison of safe abortion and post abortion care |journal=[[Global Public Health]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=236–249 |doi=10.1080/17441692.2015.1123747 |pmid=26708223 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/63643/ }}</ref> The registration fee is higher at UTH to incentivize seeking care at local clinics.

Conscientious objection reduces the number of safe abortion providers. The prevalence of conscientious objection is unknown, as there is no requirement to record it, but is likely high. The main reason for objection is [[Christianity and abortion|Christian ideas opposing abortion]]. Secondary motives include the ideas that women seeking abortion should have used birth control and that abortion providers' job is only to prevent harm. Non-objectors agree that abortion is against Christian morality, but believe the reasons for seeking safe abortion outweigh this. Doctors' views vary on which situations warrant abortion.<ref name=""Freeman & Coast"">{{Cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Emily |last2=Coast |first2=Ernestina |date=January 2019 |title=Conscientious objection to abortion: Zambian healthcare practitioners' beliefs and practices |journal=[[Social Science & Medicine]] |volume=221 |pages=106–114 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.12.018 |pmid=30578942 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Frederick Chiluba]]'s 1991 declaration that Zambia is a Christian nation contributed to doctors' conscientious objection.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> The stigma about abortion influences conscientious objection, as senior doctors may prevent doctors in their clinics from providing abortions, and people avoid talking about abortion publicly.<ref name=""Freeman & Coast"" />

Many women cannot afford to get an abortion at a hospital, and many legal abortion providers charge predatory costs.<ref name=""Phiri"" /> Fees within the official healthcare system are low and sometimes waived, but stigma and lack of knowledge prevent access.<ref name=""Coast & Murray"" /> In urban areas, ""Chinese clinics"" have become common, where Chinese doctors charge high prices to perform abortions that other doctors decline.<ref name=""Blystad et al"" /> Women who receive abortions often borrow money from friends and relatives or sell belongings to afford the procedure.

=== Unsafe abortions ===
Many abortions in Zambia are performed by illegal practitioners, locally known as ""[[Quackery|quacks]]"". A [[University of Zambia]] study found that, in five major hospitals from 2003 to 2008, 600 women obtained legal abortions, while 52,800 women were treated for abortion complications.

== Societal factors ==
[[Social norm]]s and stigma about sex, pregnancy, and abortion lead to emotional harm among women deciding whether or not to terminate their pregnancies.

Rural Zambia has low access to abortion services. Rural health bureaucrats have the job of overseeing and advising reproductive health programs. Their position is above managers of district health facilities. Bureaucrats are knowledgeable about abortion in Zambia and view it as a public health issue, though facility managers are often uninformed and their facilities do not provide abortions. The political and social sensitivity of the topic leads to many bureaucrats not discussing it outside of formal meetings. Some district health directors view abortion as an urban concern.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Haaland |first1=Marte E.

Men influence their partners who decide whether to terminate their pregnancies. Some men are not involved in their partners' pregnancies because the man denies paternity or the woman fears his response.

== Post-abortion care ==
As of 2017, between 30% and 50% of acute gynecological admissions are abortion-related.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> Due to stigma, some women receiving [[post-abortion care]] report their abortions as [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=""Leone et al"" />

At the University Teaching Hospital, the cost of post-abortion care (PAC) ranges from US$47 to $56, while a safe abortion costs between $37 and $39. The hospital spends an estimated $109,811 per year to treat unsafe abortions, thirteen times its spending on performing abortions. Nationally, the average cost of an unsafe abortion is estimated to be $52, compared to $38 for a safe abortion. Annually, the country spends between $403,000 and $3.5 million on unsafe abortions and between $221,000 and $701,000 on safe abortions. The country spent 0.2% of its health budget on PAC as of 2017.<ref name=""Parmar et al"" />

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia|COVID-19 pandemic]] led to an increase in abortion-related hospital admissions. Pandemic restrictions made it difficult to access contraceptives since people could not travel to hospitals and healthcare workers who normally distributed contraceptives were overloaded with coronavirus patients. Contraceptive distribution resumed in 2022.<ref name=""Phiri"" />

== Debate and activism ==
Some Zambians believe abortion should be banned, as it [[Christianity and abortion|violates Biblical teachings]].<ref name=""Katongo"" /> [[Christianity in Zambia|Churches in Zambia]], especially the Catholic Church and smaller churches, such as the Pentecostal Church, strongly influence the abortion debate.<ref name=""Moland et al"" /> Religious groups opposing abortion reform commonly emphasize that the current law is based on science, avoiding invoking religious arguments.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" />

In Zambia and other African countries, [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion-rights activists]] frame the issue in terms of public health.<ref name=""Moland et al"" /> They often avoid the term ""rights"" as it would conflict with anti-abortion activists' arguments about rights.<ref name=""Haaland et al"" /> Organizations such as the Society for Women and AIDS in Zambia and Youth Vision Zambia aim to address unintended pregnancies by educating citizens about [[reproductive health]].<ref name=""Katongo"" />

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Zambia.svg|150 px]]}}
Despite several steps taken by the previous government in order to fight '''corruption in [[Zambia]]''', there has not been a dramatic improvement in the public perception of anti-corruption efforts over the past years. [[Corruption]] remains pervasive in the country, yet in April 2014 the Business Anti-Corruption Portal reported that the situation in Zambia is relatively better than that of other countries in the region.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

In 2007, Zambia ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, committing to address and tackle corruption on all levels. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Zambia |first=U. S.

In 2024, Zambia scored 39 on a scale from 0 (""highly corrupt"") to 100 (""very clean"").

Unnecessarily long and complicated administrative procedures are common in [[Zambia|Zambia's]] business environment, leading many companies to operate in the [[Informal economy|informal sector]]. The risk of widespread use of [[Facilitating payment|facilitation payments]] is also high due to the bureaucratic procedures for obtaining licences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zambia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|date=April 2014|accessdate=14 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000528/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/zambia/show-all.aspx|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

Political corruption is seen as the most prevalent, specifically bribery. According to the Global Corruption Barometer Africa 2019 survey by Transparency International, 18% of public service users have paid a bribe in the past twelve months. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Global Corruption Barometer - Africa 2019 |url=https://www.transparency.org/en/gcb/africa/africa-2019 |access-date=2025-03-17 |website=Transparency.org |language=en}}</ref> 

Britain, Finland, Ireland and Sweden stopped their financial aid which was $34 million to Zambia due to corruption and [[financial mismanagement]] in 2018. A year later, Britain urged Zambia to take serious measures to fight corruption to get financial assistance. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zambia-corruption-idUSKCN1VH1S7|title=Britain urges Zambia to fight corruption to unlock aid|date=2019-08-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-08-28|language=en}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Pre-colonial period ===
Various kingdoms and empires with their own systems of governance and justice existed in Zambia during the [[History of Zambia|pre-colonial era]].<ref name=""jstor"">{{Cite journal |last=Cunnison |first=Ian |date=1961 |title=Kazembe and the Portuguese 1798-1832 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/179583 |journal=The Journal of African History |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=61–76 |issn=0021-8537}}</ref> Nevertheless, criminal activities occasionally took place. [[Kazembe|King Kazembe VII]] is best known for engaging in slavery and serial killings at [[Kazembe|Kazembe Kingdom]].<ref name=""jstor""/> The Mukuni people were also known to engage in raids and plundering of neighboring tribes, with Chief Mukuni being a notable leader in these attacks.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Eyaaz |date=2024-02-02 |title=Zambia the cradle of liberation of Southern Africa |url=https://mg.co.za/thought-leader/opinion/2024-02-02-zambia-the-cradle-of-liberation-of-southern-africa/ |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=The Mail & Guardian |language=en-ZA}}</ref>

==== Slave trade and human sacrifices ====
During the period between 1550 and 1890, there was a reputation of cruelty when it came to slavery along with human sacrifices in Kazembe Kingdom. King Kazembe VII who lived between 1780 until his assassination between 1780 and 1800 has been named as one of his key accomplices in this defilement.<ref name=""jstor""/> His infamous misdeeds were among others trafficking captured individuals as well as their sale from 1780 through1795 especially from neighboring tribes and countries in the form of slavery. He practiced human sacrifices on a large scale, with estimates suggesting that over 1,000 people were sacrificed during his reign that span from 1785 to 1790.<ref name=""jstor""/>

He was also involved in massacres where he ordered the massacre of entire villages and tribes that refused to submit to his rule or pay tribute from 1782 to 1792. He was also known for his cruel methods of punishment, including torture, mutilation, and dismemberment and numerous raids on neighboring tribes and kingdoms, plundering their resources and wealth.

==== Raids and plundering ====
The Mukuni people (1600–1850) were known to engage in raids and plundering of neighboring tribes, with Chief Mukuni (1750–1780) being a notable leader in these attacks. The [[Ngoni people]] (1820–1900) were also infamous for their cattle rustling and raids on neighboring tribes, with Chief Zwangendaba (1820–1848) leading many of these attacks.

===== Witchcraft and sorcery =====
Many pre-colonial societies in Zambia believed in witchcraft and sorcery, with accused witches being punished or killed, often without trial. The [[Bemba people]] (1600–1900) were known to practice witchcraft and sorcery, with notable practitioners such as Chief Nondo (1750–1780).

===== Tribal wars =====
Pre-colonial Zambia was characterized by frequent tribal wars over land, resources, and power. The Lozi people (1800–1900) fought numerous wars with neighboring tribes, including the Kololo people (1840–1864), led by Chief Sebetwane.

=== Colonial era ===
In the colonial period, Zambia was ruled by the [[British Empire|British]], and there was a high incidence of crime among the British colonial officials and settlers. The scandal “[[Land grabbing|Land Grab]]” involved British colonial officials as well as settlers who took over some lands from local communities without any authorization from the two countries’ constitutions followed by displacing thousands. In this scandal governor Hubert Winthrop Young played a major role with another colonial administrator [[Robert Codrington (missionary)|Robert Codrington]]. The colonial era also saw the exploitation of Zambia's natural resources, with companies such as the [[British South Africa Company]] engaging in illegal mining and trading activities.

=== Current era ===
In the current era, crime remains a significant challenge in Zambia. High-profile cases include the ""Cashgate"" scandal, where millions of dollars were embezzled from the government treasury, implicating officials such as former President [[Rupiah Banda]] and Minister of Finance Situmbeko Musokotwane. The ""Fertilizer Scandal"" saw a corrupt tendering process lead to the awarding of a contract to a company linked to then-Minister of Agriculture Given Lubinda. Other notable crimes include drug trafficking, with convicted drug lord William Harrington, and murder, with notorious criminal Kabwe Kasongo.

== Types of crimes ==

=== Corruption ===
Corruption is a pervasive crime in Zambia, with high-ranking officials and politicians embezzling funds and accepting bribes. Notable individuals involved in corruption scandals include former President Rupiah Banda and Minister of Finance Situmbeko Musokotwane.

=== Drug Trafficking ===
Drug trafficking is a significant crime in Zambia, with criminal organizations such as the ""Zambia Drug Cartel"" smuggling drugs through the country. In the 1980s, Zambia became a major transshipment point for cocaine and heroin destined for Europe and North America. The Zambia Drug Cartel, led by William Harrington, emerged as a major player in the international drug trade in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-11-02 |title=Zambian Minister Under Fire for Awarding Government Contracts |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2009-02-20-voa11-68823382/413670.html |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=Voice of America |language=en}}</ref>

In 2001, Zambian authorities seized 600 kilograms of cocaine at [[Lusaka International Airport]], marking one of the largest drug busts in the country's history. William Harrington was arrested and convicted of drug trafficking in 2003, but later escaped from prison.<ref name=""rfi.fr"">{{Cite web |date=2013-01-30 |title=International report - The Lusaka connection |url=https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20130130-drug-traffic-zambia |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=RFI |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2011-03-28 |title=Zambia struggles with growing drug menace |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12806083 |access-date=2024-07-22 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref>

The Zambian government established the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) in 2005 to combat drug trafficking. In 2010, the DEC arrested several high-ranking officials, including a former minister, for involvement in drug trafficking.

In 2012, a plane carrying 1,000 kilograms of cocaine crashed in northern Zambia, highlighting the country's continued role in the international drug trade. Zambian authorities seized 1,400 kilograms of cocaine at Lusaka International Airport in 2015, and 1,100 kilograms of cocaine at the border with Mozambique in 2020.<ref name=""rfi.fr""/>

Other reported individuals associated with drug trafficking in Zambia included William Harrington, Emmanuel Harrington (William's brother and fellow drug trafficker), Kabwe Kasongo (convicted drug trafficker), Chishimba Kambwili (former minister accused of drug trafficking and defaming president) and Xu Jing Hu (Chinese national arrested with heroin).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambian opposition leader arrested, accused of defaming president |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/8/28/zambian-opposition-leader-arrested-accused-of-defaming-president |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

=== Human Trafficking ===
Human trafficking is a serious crime in Zambia, with vulnerable individuals being exploited and forced into labor or prostitution.<ref><nowiki>https://www.herald.co.zw/zambian-in-court-for-human-trafficking/</nowiki></ref> The ""Zambia Human Trafficking Ring"" is a known criminal organization involved in this crime.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zambia |first=U.

=== Fraud ===
Fraud is a common crime in Zambia, with individuals such as businessman and politician, Hakainde Hichilema, being accused of fraudulent activities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=21 Chinese, Cameroonian convicted of internet fraud in Zambia |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/21-chinese-cameroonian-convicted-of-internet-fraud-in-zambia/3243505 |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=www.aa.com.tr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-12 |title=A “Sophisticated Internet Fraud Syndicate” has been Uncovered in Zambia - iAfrica |url=https://iafrica.com/a-sophisticated-internet-fraud-syndicate-has-been-uncovered-in-zambia/ |access-date=2024-07-22 |language=en-ZA}}</ref>

=== Murder ===
Murder is a serious crime in Zambia, with notorious criminals like Kabwe Kasongo committing heinous crimes.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-08-21 |title=Dentist convicted of killing wife on African safari given life sentence and over $15M in penalties |url=https://apnews.com/article/dentist-safari-killing-wife-zambia-insurance-fraud-e746294183467d0ebe540865e687dd30 |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-06 |title=Wife murders Zambia Army civilian |url=https://diggers.news/local/2024/04/06/wife-murders-zambia-army-civilian/ |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=Zambia: News Diggers! |language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Cybercrime ===
Cybercrime in Zambia has a growing history, with the country's increasing reliance on technology making it a target for cybercriminals. In the early 2000s, Zambia saw a rise in cybercrime, with instances of hacking and fraud reported. This led to the establishment of the [[Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority]] (ZICTA) in 2005, which aimed to regulate the ICT sector and combat cybercrime.<ref><nowiki>https://www.zicta.zm/</nowiki></ref>

In 2007, the first major cybercrime case was reported, involving a group of hackers who stole millions of dollars from Zambian banks. This incident highlighted the need for stronger cybersecurity measures and led to the establishment of a Cybercrime Unit within the Zambia Police Service in 2010. The unit was tasked with investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes.

Other crimes include Chinese nationals in Zambia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=21 Chinese, Cameroonian convicted of internet fraud in Zambia |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/21-chinese-cameroonian-convicted-of-internet-fraud-in-zambia/3243505 |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=www.aa.com.tr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-08 |title=22 Chinese nationals sentenced to prison in Zambia for cybercrimes |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-nationals-sentenced-to-prison-in-zambia-for-cybercrimes-/7647902.html |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=Voice of America |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Chinese nationals plead guilty to running Zambia scam operation |url=https://therecord.media/zambia-guilty-pleas-chinese-nationals-scam-call-center |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=therecord.media}}</ref>

In 2012, a group of cybercriminals, led by notorious hacker Emmanuel Mwale, was arrested for hacking into the Zambia Revenue Authority's database. This arrest marked a significant milestone in Zambia's fight against cybercrime. In 2015, ZICTA launched a cybersecurity awareness campaign to educate the public about online safety and best practices.

The Zambian government took a further step in 2017 by passing the Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Act, aimed at combating cybercrime. The act provided a legal framework for prosecuting cybercrimes and imposed harsh penalties on offenders. Despite these efforts, cybercrime continues to be a significant concern in Zambia, with a major data breach occurring at a leading Zambian bank in 2019 and a surge in cybercrime reported during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Individuals associated with cybercrime in Zambia include [[Esther Lungu]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mom |first=Claire |date=2024-05-31 |title=Zambia's ex-first lady, daughter arrested over 'fraud' charges |url=https://www.thecable.ng/zambias-ex-first-lady-daughter-arrested-over-fraud-charges/ |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=TheCable |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Esther Lungu: Zambian ex-first lady arrested on fraud charges |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggpp00ry5o |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=www.bbc.com |language=en-GB}}</ref>  Emmanuel Mwale, and Chibesa Kalandanya, a convicted cybercriminal. Mwanga Mwale, a cybersecurity expert and consultant, has also been involved in efforts to combat cybercrime in Zambia.

Eastern Lunda,"The '''Lunda''' people of the [[Luapula River]] valley in [[Zambia]] and [[DR Congo]] are called by others the '''''Eastern Lunda''''' to distinguish them from the [[Lunda people|'western' Lunda people]] who remained in the heartland of the former [[Lunda Kingdom]], but they themselves would use '''''Kazembe-Lunda''''' or '''Luunda''' with an elongated 'u' to make that distinction. (The name 'Lunda' may also be spelled '''Luunda''').

The Eastern Lunda migrated in the 18th century to their current area under the leader [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]. Their neighbours in northern Zambia to whom they are allied, the [[Bemba people|Bemba]], did so at the same time, and the Eastern Lunda took on the [[Bemba language]] in place of the [[Chilunda]], their original language. Their (western) Lunda compatriots in the [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] of Zambia still speak Chilunda however.

Polygamy in Zambia,"{{short description|none}}
Akin to [[Uganda]], [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Central African Republic]], '''[[Zambia]]''' is one of the few [[Christianity|Christian]] nations that allows [[polygamy|polygamous unions]] to be legally formed. Under Zambian law, [[polygamous unions]] may be contracted and they have been reported to be extremely widespread in the nation. Similar to most countries that provide polygamy as a form of marriage, the first wife must consent to the practice of [[polygamy]] before she marries her husband. If she declines, her husband will not be allowed to marry another woman while married to his current wife. According to a 2003 survey, 16% of [[marriages]] in Zambia are polygamous. While frequently more common in rural areas, the practice can also be found in more urban settings.<ref>[http://genderindex.org/country/zambia Polygamy in Zambia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222104156/http://genderindex.org/country/zambia|date=2012-02-22}}</ref>

Zambian Law recognizes two kinds of marriage; Statutory marriages under the Marriage Act and customary marriage under different customs that may vary from tribe to tribe. Polygamy is not allowed for those married under the Marriage Act. It is a criminal offense (bigamy) for a person married under the Act to undergo a marriage ceremony whilst legally married to another person. Customary law marriages are potentially polygamous. Whether a man needs consent of his existing wife or wives before taking another wife or wives depends on the particular customs governing the marriage.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, prostitution occurred along the long-distance trade routes, especially around the rest houses.<ref name=""uni"">{{cite web|last1=Walya|first1=Mazala, Kaonga|title=For pleasure and profit:Sex Work in Zambia,c.1880-1964|url=http://dspace.unza.zm:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/2215/Main%20Document.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=University of Zambia|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>

From 1850, the number of [[Europe]]ans settling in Zambia increased greatly. Most were single men who employed 'Cook Boys’ as servants. Part of the duties of the 'Cook Boys’ was to procure prostitutes for their employers. The woman became known as 'Cook Women’.<ref name=""uni"" />

Starting from in the 1900s, many men moved from the rural areas to the emerging industrial areas to find work. Some worked in the tin and lead mines at [[Kabwe]], others worked on the construction of the [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] to Katanga railway. These men. living away from their wives, created a demand for prostitution in these areas.<ref name=""uni"" /> In Lusaka, prostitutes set up settlements alongside the worker's residential areas.<ref name=""uni"" />

In the 1920s and 1930s, large scale mining in the [[Copperbelt]] was established. The mine workers created a huge demand for prostitution. The prostitutes also cooked and washed for the miners and were known as 'comfort women'.<ref name=""uni"" />

By 1930, [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]] were highly prevalent amongst migrant workers. The Native Authorities expelled all unmarried women from migrant worker's camps in the Copperbelt. The Colonial Government set up blockades at bus stops and transit routes in 1939 in an attempt to stop the prostitutes travelling to the areas men were working in. As a result, [[brothel]]s started to appear along the migrant labour routes, these routes becoming known as 'whores’ tracks'. Thee [[Mulobezi]] – [[Mongu]] trail in the [[Western Province, Zambia|Western Province]] was particularly known for its brothels.<ref name=""uni"" />

Following Zambia's win over Ghana in the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations]]'s semi-final, many prostitutes offered supporters free sex as part of the celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prostitutes celebrate Zambia's win by offering free sex|url=https://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=91514&page=archive-read|website=The Namibian|accessdate=16 March 2018|language=en|date=10 February 2012}}</ref>

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Zambia}}
Zambia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. While orphans and street children are most vulnerable, children of affluent village families are also at risk of trafficking because sending children to the city for work is perceived to confer status. Zambian boys and girls are exploited in sex trafficking by truck drivers in towns along the [[Zimbabwe]]an and [[Tanzania]]n borders and by miners in [[Solwezi]]. Zambian boys are subjected to sex trafficking in Zimbabwe and women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in [[South Africa]]. Domestically, extended families and trusted family acquaintances facilitate trafficking.<ref name=""state17"" />

Women and children from neighboring countries are exploited in sex trafficking in Zambia. [[China|Chinese]] traffickers bring in Chinese women and girls for sexual exploitation in brothels and [[massage parlor]]s in Lusaka; traffickers use front companies posing as travel agencies to lure Chinese victims and coordinate with Zambian facilitators and middlemen. Potential trafficking victims from [[Ethiopia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[Syria]] were identified in Zambia.<ref name=""state17"">{{cite web|title=Zambia 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271315.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703181557/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271315.htm|url-status=dead |archive-date=3 July 2017|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=16 March 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

==Background==
[[Zambia]] gained independence in 1964 from [[British Colonial Empire|the British Empire]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=HISTORY OF ZAMBIA|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=ad27|website=www.historyworld.net|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> Post independence, Pentecostal and charismatic missionaries from the [[United States]] were met with a wide audience in the 1970s. The growth of the religion suffered during the 80s and 90s on account of increased economic turmoil. After [[Frederick Chiluba]] (a Pentecostal Christian) became President in 1991, Pentecostal congregations expanded considerably around the country.<ref name=""pentecostal"">{{cite thesis| author=Matthew Steel| title=Pentecostalism in Zambia : Power, Authority and the Overcomers| type=MSc Dissertation| publisher=University of Wales| year=2005}}</ref> While the initial constitution did not specify religion, the amendment in 1996 declared the nation as ""a Christian nation while upholding the right of every person to enjoy the person's freedom of conscience and religion"". As per Article 1 of the constitution, the nation is a Sovereign Secular Republic and as per Article 25, citizens free to express thoughts and practice any religion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Law, Religion, Constitution: Freedom of Religion, Equal Treatment, and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4I8WDAAAQBAJ&q=zambia+religion&pg=PA164|page=164|first1=W.

In September 2021 the newly elected president, [[Hakainde Hichilema]], disbanded the [[Ministry of National Guidance and Religious Affairs]] and put regulating religions under the control of the Office of the Vice President.<ref name=""state2021""/>

The government requires religious groups to affiliate with a ""mother body"" which in 2021 were 14 in number.   The Christian ones were Zambia Conference of Catholic Bishops (ZCCB), Council of Churches in Zambia (CCZ), and Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia (EFZ), Independent Churches of Zambia, Apostles Council of Churches, Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Christian Missions in Many Lands.  The non-Christian ones were Islamic Supreme Council of Zambia, Hindu Association of Zambia, Guru Nanak Council of Zambia, Jewish Board of Deputies Zambia, Rastafarians, Council for Zambia Jewry, and Baha’i Faith in Zambia.<ref name=""state2021"">{{cite web |title=2021 Report on International Religious Freedom: Zambia |url=https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-report-on-international-religious-freedom/zambia/ |website=United States Department of State |access-date=2 July 2022 |date=2 June 2022}}</ref>

== Christianity ==
{{main|Christianity in Zambia}}
[[File:David Livingstone by Thomas Annan.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[David Livingstone]]]]
Christianity is believed to have arrived in Zambia in the form of European Protestant missionaries and African explorers during the mid of 19th century. [[David Livingstone]] was a Scottish missionary who did pioneering missionary work that brought the attention of Africa to the Western world. Livingstone inspired abolitionists of the slave trade, explorers and missionaries. He led the way in Central Africa to missionaries who initiated the education and health care for Africans. Many African chiefs and tribes held him in high esteem and it was one of the major reasons for facilitating relations between them and the British.<ref name=""Blaikie"">{{cite book|last=Blaikie|first= William Garden|year=1880|title=The Personal Life of David Livingstone|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13262|access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>

[[Zambia]] is officially a [[Christian]] nation according to the 1996 constitution,<ref name=""const"" /> but a wide variety of religious traditions exist. Traditional religious thought blends easily with Christian beliefs in many of the country's [[syncretism|syncretic]] churches. Christian denominations include: [[Presbyterianism]], [[Catholicism in Zambia|Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Pentecostal]], [[New Apostolic Church]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Branhamism]], and a variety of [[Evangelical]] denominations. These grew, adjusted and prospered from the original Catholic missionary settlements ([[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] influences) in the east from [[Mozambique]] and Anglicanism (English and Scottish influences) from the south. Except for some technical positions (e.g. physicians), Western missionary roles have been assumed by native believers.<ref name=""pentecostal""/> Zambia has one of the largest communities of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in Africa with over 200,000 members.<ref>{{cite web|title=2023 Country and Territory Reports|year=2023|url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/2023-service-year-report/2023-country-territory/|publisher=Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society of Pennsylvania}}</ref>

==Humanists and Atheists of Zambia==

'''Humanists and Atheists of Zambia''' (HAZ) is a [[nonprofit organization]] founded in 2018 by Larry Mukwemba Tepa, with Thasiyana Mwandila serving as Vice-President.<ref name=""humanists_creation-of-the-podcast"">{{cite web |title=""Humanism in Zambia"": creation of a 12-episode podcast to spread humanism in the country |url=https://humanists.international/grantee/creation-of-the-podcast-humanism-in-zambia/ |website=Humanists International |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref> The organisation promotes [[secular humanism]] and aims to normalise [[atheism]] in Zambia, where nonbelief is often widely stigmatised.<ref>{{cite web |title=""On we go"": Zambian humanists and atheists look forward to first national meeting – despite moral panic |url=https://humanists.international/2019/07/on-we-go-zambian-humanists-atheists-look-forward-to-first-national-meeting-despite-moral-panic/ |website=Humanists International |date=3 July 2019 |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

HAZ organises campaigns and public discussions on topics related to humanism, [[secularism]], and [[human rights]].<ref name=""humanists_creation-of-the-podcast""/> In June 2019, HAZ announced a youth conference scheduled for October that year; the announcement prompted a backlash on social media and calls from some quarters for the Ministry of National Guidance and Religious Affairs (later a department of the Office of the Vice-President) to intervene.<ref>{{cite web |title=Will the Zambian government stop atheist gathering in October? |url=https://zambianeye.com/will-the-zambian-government-stop-atheist-gathering-in-october/ |website=Zambian Eye |date=27 June 2019 |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=National Guidance & Religious Affairs – Office of the Vice President |url=https://www.ovp.gov.zm/?page_id=6854 |website=Office of the Vice-President (Zambia) |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

In 2020, Larry Mukwemba Tepa also established the '''Ethical Society of Zambia''', a national secular humanist community and umbrella for mutual-aid and secular service projects in the country. According to the organisation’s mission statement, the Ethical Society is rooted in secular humanism and naturalism and seeks to promote reason, compassion, democracy, sustainability and human flourishing without reliance on supernatural beliefs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission and Vision |url=https://ethicalsocietyzambia.wordpress.com/mission-and-vision/ |website=The Ethical Society of Zambia |access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>

The '''1990 Zambian coup d'état attempt''' was a [[Zambian Defence Force|military]] [[coup d'état]] attempt that took place in [[Zambia]] on 1 July 1990. The coup lasted no more than 6 hours and took place between 3 and 9 A.M. when the coup's leader, Lieutenant [[Mwamba Luchembe]] of the [[Zambian Army]], announced via the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation|ZNBC]] (national radio station) that the military had taken over the government and he cited riots of the previous week as reasons for his action; about 27 people had died in the riots, while more than 100 were wounded. Although Lieutenant Luchembe's coup attempt against the then President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] failed, it weakened Kaunda's political power, which was already shaky after three days of rioting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/world/failed-zambia-coup-weakens-leader.html|title=Failed Zambia Coup Weakens Leader|author=Jane Perlez|date=1 July 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=27 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1990/07/01/internacional/646783218_850215.html|title=Kaunda supera un intento de golpe de Estado en Zambia|author=|date=1 July 1990|publisher=El País|language=Spanish|accessdate=10 June 2020}}</ref>

The '''2022 census of Zambia''' was a detailed enumeration of the Zambian population that became the sixth national census in the country since independence. It began on August 18, 2022, and concluded by September 14, 2022.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.znbc.co.zm/news/2022-census-set-for-august|title = 2022 CENSUS SET FOR AUGUST}}</ref> It became Zambia's first-ever digitally conducted population census.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://english.news.cn/africa/20220608/9ae33667b5544151aaec8c4b5a257142/c.html |title = Zambia's first-ever electronic population census in financial deficit }}</ref>

==Background==
The Zambia Statistics Agency is mandated to conduct the Census of Population and Housing (CPH) every 10 years as per Statistics Act No. 13 of 2018.
The Census was supposed to be conducted in 2020 but was postponed to November 2021 due to funding challenges. In November 2021, the census failed to take place due to delays in procurement of materials needed for the census.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2021/11/04/postponed-6th-national-census-of-population-and-housing-creates-room-for-consultation-dr-musokotwane/ |title =Postponed 6th National census of Population and Housing creates room for consultation – Dr Musokotwane }}</ref>
The 2022 census became the sixth conducted in independent Zambia; the first was conducted in 1969 and thereafter,  1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/help-zambia-conduct-population-census/ |title = Help Zambia conduct population census }}</ref>

==Administration==
Zambia Statistics Agency conducted the sixth census of population and Housing.

'''Amanaz''' was a [[Zamrock]] band founded in 1973 in [[Kitwe]], [[Zambia]].<ref name="":1"" /> The group released their only album, the acclaimed ''Africa'', in 1975. Amanaz drew influences from American and British rock of the late 1960s–early 1970s, especially the music of [[Jimi Hendrix]], and from traditional [[Music of Zambia|Zambian music]], identifiable in Watson Lungu's drumming and Keith Kabwe's vocals.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Deming|date=|title=Africa - Amanaz|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/africa-mw0001957626|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-08-25|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us}}</ref>

The band's name is the [[acronym]] of ""Ask Me About Nice Artistes in Zambia"".<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web|last=Chanda|first=Davies M.M|date=8 August 2014|title=When Amanaz Band's beats rocked Europe|url=http://www.times.co.zm/?p=29814|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415152017/http://www.times.co.zm/?p=29814|archive-date=2019-04-15|access-date=2019-01-13|website=[[Times of Zambia]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Past members include Keith Kabwe, Isaac Mpofu, John Kanyepa, Jerry Mausala and Watson Lungu.

== History ==
In 1973, the band recorded in the Malachite Film Studios of [[Chingola]] their sole album named ''Africa.''<ref name="":3"" /> It was first released as a [[LP record|LP]] in 1975, and since then re-issued by the German label Shadocks Music in 2008,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Goranson Sandberg|first=Henning|date=22 July 2013|title=Why Zamrock is back in play|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/zamrock-zambia-music-rerelease|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-08-25|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}</ref> and by the American label [[Now Again Records|Now-Again Records]] in 2015. Of the 12 songs of the album, three are performed in the [[Bemba language]] and the rest in English.<ref name="":3"" />

The album continues to be influential as an embodiment of a strain of [[Zamrock]]. [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] journalist Nate Patrin described it as ""both behind and ahead of its era"" and therefore uniquely ""out of time"".<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web|last=Patrin|first=Nate|date=30 March 2010|title=Amanaz: Africa|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14050-africa/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-11|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en}}</ref> Music critic Mark Deming noted that Amanaz's music was based on ""deep, bluesy grooves with a strong psychedelic undercurrent and thick layers of fuzz guitar"".<ref name="":3"" />

Amanaz split up in 1976. Keith Kabwe, the former band leader and main vocalist, then created the short-lived band Drive Unit the same year.<ref name="":0"" />

By 2014, Keith Kabwe served as a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] pastor in [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala]] and was working on the release of [[Gospel music|gospel songs]].<ref name="":0"" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Chris A.|date=5 August 2014|title=We're a Zambian Band|url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/7/were-a-zambian-band|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-08-25|website=[[The Appendix]]}}</ref>

Amanaz's song ""Khala My Friend"" has been featured in several television shows and films. In 2012, it appeared on the soundtrack of [[Rick Alverson]]'s ""[[The Comedy (film)|The Comedy]]."" In 2016, the song was featured in Season 1, Episode 2 of the [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] show “[[People of Earth]],” as well as Season 3, Episode 1 of the [[HBO]] show [[High Maintenance]].<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=2016-09-16|title=High Maintenance|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/high-maintenance/season-3/76679|access-date=2024-07-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=[[TuneFind]]}}</ref> Then again in 2021, in the closing credits of Season 2, Episode 3 (""Do the Right-est Thing"") of the [[Apple TV+]] series ''[[Ted Lasso]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=2021-08-06|title=Ted Lasso Soundtrack|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/ted-lasso/season-2/110267|access-date=2021-08-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=[[TuneFind]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Phipps|first=Keith|date=2021-08-06|title=Ted Lasso Recap: Bizarro Ted|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/ted-lasso-recap-season-2-episode-3-do-the-right-est-thing.html|access-date=2021-08-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=[[Vulture.com|The Vulture]]}}</ref>

In 2023, a song from their 1975 album [[Africa (Amanaz album)|Africa]], ""Nsunka Lwendo"" was sampled on American Rapper [[Travis Scott]]' song ""[[Sirens (Travis Scott song)|Sirens]]"" from his 2023 album [[Utopia (Travis Scott album)|Utopia]].

The '''Apostolic Vicariate of Bangueolo''' was a vicariate established by the Catholic [[White Fathers]] missionary society in 1913 located in what is now [[Zambia]].

==Origins==

The Apostolic Vicariate of Bangueolo has its origins in the White Fathers mission at [[Mambwe Mwela]], {{convert|100|km}} to the east of [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala]], established in 1891. The missionaries moved to [[Kayambi]] in 1895. In 1897 the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Nyassa]] was separated from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Tanganyika]], covering what is now Malawi and the north and east of Zambia. Bishop [[Joseph Dupont (bishop)|Joseph Dupont]] was the first Vicar Apostolic of Nyassa.{{sfn|Kasama Archdiocese: Our History}}
On 28 January 1913 the Apostolic Vicariate of Bangueolo was separated from Nyassa.{{sfn|Kasama Archdiocese: Our History}}

==History==

The new vicariate of Bangweulu covered the Northern and Luapula Regions, while the south east part kept the name Nyassa.{{sfn|Hamann|2010}}
On 28 January 1913 Bishop [[Etienne-Benoît Larue]] was consecrated as the first Vicar Apostolic.{{sfn|Archdiocese of Kasama: GCatholic}}
In 1913 the Bangweulu vicariate had six mission stations, twenty five priests, eight [[Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Africa|White Sisters]] and six lay brothers. 
There were 246 catechists and 5,800 baptized Christians.{{sfn|Garvey|1994|p=113}}
The vicariate bordered [[German East Africa]].  It became a war zone when [[World War II]] (1914-1918) started.
The population suffered from food requisitions, taxes and forced levies of men to act as porters and to do other war-related work.  Missionaries were called up to work in the hospitals or as chaplains with the troops.{{sfn|Garvey|1994|p=114}}

On 23 May 1933 the northeast  was separated as the Mission Sui Juris of [[Mission of Lwangwa|Lwangwa]], administered by Fr. [[Jan Cornelius van Sambeek]].{{sfn|Hamann|2010}}
On 5 October 1935 Bishop Larue died and was succeeded by Bishop [[Alexandre-Auguste-Laurent-Marie Roy]].
On 10 March 1949 Mgr. Alexander Roy resigned as Vicar Apostolic and was succeeded by [[Marcel Daubechies]].{{sfn|Archdiocese of Kasama: GCatholic}}

On 10 July 1952 the western part of the vicariate became [[Apostolic Prefecture of Fort Rosebery]] (Mansa), 
while the eastern part became the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Kasama]].{{sfn|Kasama Archdiocese: Our History}}
Marcel Daubechies remained as Vicar Apostolic of Kasama.{{sfn|Archdiocese of Kasama: GCatholic}}

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2021}}

The '''Chitimukulu''' is the King or Paramount Chief of the [[Bemba people|Bemba]], the largest ethnic group in [[Zambia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chitimukulu|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/113326/Chitimukulu|access-date=4 August 2011|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> All Chitimukulus, as well as lesser Bemba chiefs, are members of the [[Bena Ng'andu]] (English: ''Crocodile Clan''). Potential successors to the ruling Chikimukulu are chosen from the various Bemba chiefs.<ref name=""HDZ"">{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Zambia|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8108-5305-8|editor-last=Simon|editor-first=David J.|edition=3rd|series=African Historical Dictionaries|volume=106|location=Metuchen, New Jersey|pages=65–6|contribution=Chitimukulu|editor2-last=Pletcher|editor2-first=James R.|editor3-last=Siegel|editor3-first=Brian V.}}</ref>

The king's title comes from the first recorded Chitimukulu, who was originally named [[Chiti Muluba]], but changed his name to ''Chiti Mukulu'' ({{Literal translation|Chiti the Great}}). In the 18th century, the Bemba came out from their original lands in the [[Luba Empire]] of [[Mukulumpe]] in [[DR Congo]] to eventually settle the country around [[Kasama, Zambia|Kasama]] in Zambia's [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern Province]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The original Bemba Kings are said to have been descendants of King Mukulumpe and his last wife Mumbi Mukasa who belonged to the Crocodile Clan. Together, they had four children: Katongo, Nkole, Chiti and Chilufya Mulenga. The Bemba were given a kingdom to rule by their father. According to legend, they then built a tower to help them see approaching enemies from a distance, but the tower collapsed, causing several deaths. The Bemba leaders were called by their father to exculpate themselves but in the end, their elder brother was arrested and blinded to send a message to his young brothers. After the Bemba Kings saw the cruelty of their father, they decided to leave and settle where they would find a dead crocodile. After years of wandering in [[Zambia]] the Bemba settled in [[Mungwi District]], having found a dead crocodile. The first Chitimukulu to settle in [[Lubemba]] (Upemba) was Chilufya Mulenga.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Following the death of [[Chitimukulu Chilufya Mwango Chitapankwa III]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=4 April 2012|title=President Michael Sata mourns Paramount Chief Chitimukulu|url=https://www.lusakatimes.com/2012/04/04/president-michael-sata-mourns-paramount-chief-chitimukulu/|access-date=14 October 2012|website=Lusaka Times|language=en-GB}}</ref> Henry Kanyanta Sosola Chitimukulu was formally recognised and confirmed as the 38th King of the Bemba on the 25 January 2015.

The '''coat of arms of Zambia''' was adopted on 24 October 1964 when the Republic of Zambia reached its independence. This coat of arms is adapted from the arms of the British [[protectorate]] of [[Northern Rhodesia]] which dated to 1927, with the wavy black and white vertical lines as the field and the eagle (then holding a fish) in the chief. 

The [[African fish eagle]] represents the conquest of freedom and nation's hope for the future.  The hoe and pickaxe represent the country's economic backbone: agriculture and mining, as well as the characteristics that have influenced Zambia's evolution and nature. The shield is a representation of [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] with white water cascading over black rock. The Victoria Falls represents the [[Zambezi river]], from which Zambia takes its name.{{sfn|Talocci|Smith|1982|p=159}}  The coat of arms also has emblems of Zambia's natural resources: minerals and mining, agriculture and wildlife. The shield is supported by two figures which represent the common man and woman of the nation. The country's motto is ""One Zambia, One Nation{{sfn|Talocci|Smith|1982|p=159}} which emphasises the need for unity in a country of over 72 ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sh.gov.zm/?page_id=5663|title=Coat of Arms|website=Republic of Zambia: State House|access-date=24 May 2019|archive-date=17 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417083035/http://www.sh.gov.zm/?page_id=5663|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The wavy black and white vertical lines also were present in the shield of the [[coat of arms of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] 1954-1963.

Eastern Lunda,"The '''Lunda''' people of the [[Luapula River]] valley in [[Zambia]] and [[DR Congo]] are called by others the '''''Eastern Lunda''''' to distinguish them from the [[Lunda people|'western' Lunda people]] who remained in the heartland of the former [[Lunda Kingdom]], but they themselves would use '''''Kazembe-Lunda''''' or '''Luunda''' with an elongated 'u' to make that distinction. (The name 'Lunda' may also be spelled '''Luunda''').

The Eastern Lunda migrated in the 18th century to their current area under the leader [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]. Their neighbours in northern Zambia to whom they are allied, the [[Bemba people|Bemba]], did so at the same time, and the Eastern Lunda took on the [[Bemba language]] in place of the [[Chilunda]], their original language. Their (western) Lunda compatriots in the [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] of Zambia still speak Chilunda however.

The '''Examinations Council of [[Zambia]]''' (ECZ) was established under the Examinations Council of Zambia Act of 1983,<ref>{{cite web |title=Examinations Council of Zambia Act |date=1983-08-12 |number=Volume 10 |url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/877 |format=HTML |publisher=National Assembly of Zambia }}</ref> to set and conduct examinations and award certificates to successful candidates.
The Examinations are given to Grade 7 students before they move on to secondary examination, Grade 9 students as well as Grade 12 school leaving students.
Additionally, the Examinations are taken by those that did not have the opportunity to have a formal education as part of leveling up for newer jobs and positions.

Compared to most contemporary examinations it ranks as harder in the scales.

Ishindi-Lunda people,"The '''Ishindi-Lunda''' (also called the ''Western Lunda'') are an ethnic group living mainly in the [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] of [[Zambia]] under Senior [[Chief Ishindi]], around the provincial capital [[Zambezi, Zambia|Zambezi]]. The Lunda people of [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] consists of [[Kanongesha-Lunda people|Kanongesha Lunda]] and Ishindi Lunda.

They descend from the [[Lunda people]] of the [[Lunda Kingdom]] and are closely related to Lunda people in [[Angola]] and [[DR Congo]] who all speak [[Lunda language|Chilunda]]. They are also related to the [[Kazembe-Lunda|Kazembe-Lunda or Eastern Lunda]], but the latter speak [[Bemba language|Chibemba]].

Ishindi Lunda established [[Zambezi, Zambia|Zambezi]] as the capital after leaving the [[Lunda Kingdom]] led by the [[Chief Ishindi]], the first born son of [[Mwata Yamvo|Mwata Yamvo or Mwaant Yav]]. The arrival and conquest by the Ishindi Lunda is remembered in a traditional ceremony, held annually in August, called [[Lunda Lubanza]]. The ceremony that was revived in 1983 after a long absence.<ref>[http://musicinafrica.net/directory/lunda-lubanza?language=en, Musicinafrica.net], Lunda Lubanza, 7 October 2016</ref> The ceremony signifies the conquest of the Ishindi Lunda in successfully fulfilling a mission that [[Chief Ishindi]] was given by his father, [[Mwata Yamvo|Mwata Yamvo or Mwaant Yav]], to expand the [[Kingdom of Lunda]] dynasty. In the 1854 ceremony, Scottish missionary Dr David Livingstone is said to have attended and he was honoured by [[Mwant shindi Kawumbu]].<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200909030244.html Zambia: Mwati Yamv Preaches Peace At Lunda Lubanza Ceremony, 7 October 2016]</ref><ref>[http://kutachika.com/lunda-lubanza/ Lunda Lubanza, 7 October 2016]</ref>

[[Zambia]] is officially a [[Christian]] country, with adherents of [[Islam]] forming 2.7% of the population in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia |url=https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/zambia |access-date=2025-03-29 |website=United States Department of State |language=en-US}}</ref> However, Zambia's constitution guarantees the freedom of religion and conscience, and [[Muslims]] are free to proselytize and build places of worship in the country.

== History ==
[[File:Zambia Lusaka Independence Avenue Krzysztof Błażyca 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A mosque in  Lusaka]]
The presence of Islam in Zambia dates after the 12th century onward when Muslims established emirates on the coast of [[East Africa]]. In the 18th century, Muslim ivory and slave merchants extended their business to the hinterland regions reaching [[Zambia]] in the period of the Omani dynasty [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Said]]. Muslim traders entered Zambia from their trading bases on the coast of [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]]. 

The earliest permanent community of Muslims in Zambia emerged in the early 20th century when [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] merchants settled in [[Lusaka]].<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal |last=Mwale |first=Nelly |date=2022-06-06 |title=Media Representations of Local Muslim Associations' Acts of Charity in Zambia's Multi-Religious but Christian-Dominated Context since the 2010s |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/21540993-01202003 |journal=Islamic Africa |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=47–65 |doi=10.1163/21540993-01202003 |s2cid=250436656 |issn=0803-0685|url-access=subscription }}</ref> 

Many Muslims entered Zambia during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] period, primarily came from the [[Indian subcontinent]] establishing themselves along the railways in the central part of the country from [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] to [[Lusaka]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Juergensmeyer|first1=Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwJzAwAAQBAJ&dq=islam+zambia&pg=PA1399|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|last2=Roof|first2=Wade Clark|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4522-6656-5|pages=1399–1400|language=en}}</ref> In the 1970's, Zambian Muslims began registering associations for organizing the activities and resources of the community. Multiple associations exist that represent different ethnic groups and branches of Islamic practices.<ref name="":0"" />

== Demographics ==
In 2014, there are 100,000 Muslims in Zambia, representing 2.7% of total population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia |url=https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/zambia/ |access-date=2025-03-29 |website=United States Department of State |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Zambia Religion Facts & Stats|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Zambia/Religion|access-date=2021-07-09|website=www.nationmaster.com}}</ref> Although Zambia is officially a ""Christian Nation"" there is freedom of religion and Muslims generally are accepted in the society. The vast majority of [[Muslim]]s in Zambia are [[Sunni]]. A small [[Ismaili]] Shia community is also present. There are about 500 people belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbElAQAAIAAJ|title=Some basics of religious education in Zambia|year=2007|publisher=Mission Press |isbn=9789982073370|access-date=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

Most Zambian Muslims are of Indian descent though there is a significant native convert community. Immigrants from [[West Africa]] and the Middle East comprise the rest of the Muslim population.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Scott D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q39lhjRIj2kC&dq=islam+zambia&pg=PA35|title=Culture and Customs of Zambia|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0-313-33246-3|pages=35|language=en}}</ref>

In 2001, neighbouring [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's government]] undertook aggressive land reform policies which included invasions of [[White people in Zimbabwe|farms owned by White Zimbabweans]].

Lukanga Twa,"{{No footnotes|date=June 2022}}
The [[Twa peoples|Twa]] of the [[Lukanga Swamp]] of [[Zambia]] are one of several [[fishing]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] [[caste]]s living in a patron–client relationship with farming [[Bantu peoples]] across central and southern Africa. The Lukanga Twa live primarily among the [[Lenje people|Lenje]], and speak the [[Lenje language]].

In [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Province]], where swampy terrain means that large-scale crops cannot be planted near the main rivers, only the Twa fish. They exchanged their catch for agricultural produce from their patrons. Up to the 1920s the Twa built their huts on the marshes, but they were moved to higher ground for ease of taxation. By the 1970s many of the Twa identified as Lenje, and consequently abandoned fishing, as the Lenje have a strong cultural aversion to that activity. They have been replaced by immigrants to the region, primarily [[Luvale people|Luvale]] and [[Malawi]]ans.

==History==

Senior African employees first considered forming their own union in 1948, but were discouraged by government officials tasked with establishing trade union representation for black mineworkers, who considered that having multiple unions would undermine the African workers' bargaining position with the employers.

The MASA was first recognized by the companies following the major strikes of 1955, led by the rival [[African Mineworkers' Union]] (AMU). The AMU aimed to be an [[industrial unionism|industrial union]] for all African miners in Northern Rhodesia, and regarded the MASA as a [[company union]] which divided the African workforce for the benefit of the mining companies.<ref name=Berger/>

Mount Makulu Research Station,"{{short description|Agricultural research station in Zambia}}
{{Coord|15|33||S|28|11||E|region:ZM|display=title}}
The '''Mount Makulu Research Station''' is an agricultural research station situated near [[Chilanga (Lusaka), Zambia|Chilanga]], c. 15&nbsp;km south of [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]].

It was started in the 1950s by the British Government after the Second World War, while Zambia was a British colony.
During the 1950s and 1960s Mount Makulu was home to an expatriate community of notably English and Dutch residents and to the local African population. Named after a local hill, called Mount Makulu, it was involved in various research activities related to, for example, grasses and silage. It was a thriving if small community with a local tennis club built by the residents. The nearest town is Chilanga, which has local schools and whose main industry is the manufacture of cement.

After Zambia gained its independence from Britain under President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] in 1964, Mount Makulu continued as an agricultural research station as a part of the Department of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries of Zambia.

The Mount Makulu Research Station is also the headquarters of the [[Zambia Agriculture Research Institute]] (ZARI).

Mpika railway station,"{{Short description|Railway station in Zambia}}
'''Mpika''' is a major intermediate [[railway station]] on the [[TAZARA Railway]] in northern [[Transport in Zambia|Zambia]]. Located in the town of [[Mpika]], it has a passenger station, and many goods sidings.

|previous=[[Chilonga]]|term1=New [[Kapiri Mposhi]]|next=Sabwa|term2=[[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]]|route=[[TAZARA Railway]]|col=257059}}
{{S-end}}

== Description ==
[[Image:Diagram Mpika 2007.JPG|frame|Mpika railway station in Zambia]]

At the centre of Mpika railway station is a [[crossing loop]] and several parallel sidings mainly used for shunting.  The passenger station with a grand entrance is located at this point with a prominent road opposite.

Two shunting necks connect North and South of the station, the northern shunting neck merging with the Master Siding.  Level crossing(s) that may have existed in the past have been replaced by underbridge(s).

Sidings where freight may be loaded and unloaded existing in several places.  These are concentrated to the north east of the station in a complex of several sidings, which connect to the station via a 180 degree master siding.  This master siding dives under the main line for two reasons, firstly to avoid sharper curves, and secondly to connect with the crossing loop rather than the passenger platform.  The goods depot is very close to the passenger station which helps supervision.

There appears to be an engine depot with a number of sidings connecting to the master siding to the north west. <ref> [http://wikimapia.org/18230266/Mpika-Railway-Station-and-Yard Map ] </ref>

==Production==
[[File:Munkoyo Roots.jpg|thumb|The roots of Munkoyo used to create the drink]]

The '''New Heritage Party''' is a [[political party]] in [[Zambia]]. Founded in 2001 as the Heritage Party it was shut down after the 2011 elections, but was revived by [[Chishala Kateka]] in 2020 as the New Heritage Party.

==History==
The party was formed in 2001 by [[Godfrey Miyanda]] after he left the [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] over President [[Frederick Chiluba]]'s plans to run for a third term in office.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Lansford|editor1-first=Tom|title=Political handbook of the world 2014|date=2014|publisher=CQ Press|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1483333281|page=1617}}</ref> In the [[Zambian general election, 2001|December 2001 general elections]] Miyanda stood as the party's presidential candidate, finishing fifth in a field of eleven candidates with 8% of the vote. The party also received 8% of the vote in the [[National Assembly (Zambia)|National Assembly]] elections, winning four seats.<ref>[https://eisa.org.za/wep/zam2001results.htm Zambia: 2001 National Assembly election results] EISA</ref>

In the [[Zambian general election, 2006|2006 elections]] Miyanda was the party's presidential candidate again, but saw his vote share fall to 1.6%; in the National Assembly elections the party's vote share was reduced to 1.3% and it lost all four seats. Miyanda stood for president again in [[Zambian presidential election, 2008|2008]], but received less than 0.8% of the vote, finishing last amongst the four candidates.

The [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 general elections]] saw Miyanda's share of the presidential vote reduced to 0.2%, whilst the party received just 485 votes in the National Assembly elections (0.02%). Miyanda ran for a fifth time in the [[Zambian presidential election, 2015|2015 presidential elections]], finishing eighth in a field of eleven candidates with 0.3% of the vote.

In 2020, Chishala Kateka, founding member and chairperson of the finance committee for the original Heritage Party, revived the party as the New Heritage Party in her bid for the presidency.<ref name=""ZO-2020"">{{Cite news|title=Chishala Kateka |date=6 December 2020 |url=https://zambianobserver.com/pf-worst-administration-post-independence-kateka/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201206152320/https://zambianobserver.com/pf-worst-administration-post-independence-kateka/ |archive-date=6 December 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> She said that the new party had gone beyond the old Heritage manifesto, and had their own.<ref name=""ZO-2020"" />

Nsenga people,"{{Short description|Ethnic group in Africa}}
{{More citations needed|date=November 2024}}
The '''Nsenga''', not to be confused with the [[Senga people|Senga]], are a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic tribe of [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]. In Zambia, they are found in two districts of Eastern province namely Nyimba and Petauke. They are also dialects with the Nsenga Luzi of the Luangwa valley in Chief Nyalugwe, Mboloma and Lwembe and the Chikunda of Luangwa Boma (Feira).<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e_hADwAAQBAJ&dq=%C2%A0Nsenga+%C2%A0people&pg=PT421|title= Almanac of African Peoples and Nations}}</ref>

Their Senior Chief is Kalindawalo M'ndikula, who resides in Merwe 10 kilometers from Petauke Boma. The following are Nsenga Chiefs: Chiefs Mwape, Nyamphande, Nyanje, Mumbi, Sandwe, Nyalugwe, Ndake, Senior Chief Lwembe, Senior Chief Mboloma and Mwanjaw'anthu.

They are known for their culture and artwork which includes bead work and basketry. They also grow groundnuts, maize, millet and sorghum for consumption and cotton as cash crop. 

The [[Nsenga language]] (also called Chinsenga) spoken by people of this tribe has been adopted by many groups in Zambia. 

== Origin ==

The Nsenga people are believed to have migrated into Zambia around the 14th century from the Luba – Lunda kingdom of Congo, the current Democratic Republic of Congo, as distinct language. Nsenga means journey in reference to the tribe's long trek from Luba Kingdom. The Nsenga people share much more same culture with the lala, Lamba, Aushi, Swaka, Bemba and Bisa people due to strong historical links to the same pattern of migration movements as the lamba, swaka, Bemba lala and Bisa speaking people as they left Luba Kingdom in search for more fertile land. 

A typical vocabulary analysis on selected tribes with links to theLuba Kingdom, further proves that Nsenga was indeed a distinct language and clearly dispels the assumption that Nsenga could have been an off short of Chewa speaking people. Nsenga people originate from Luba Kingdom alongside other tribes such as lala, Bemba, lamba and the Bisa people. The Nsenga people are among the earliest tribes to migrate into modern day Zambia after the Tonga speaking people. It is believed that the Nsenga speaking people embarked on the trekking journey (Nsenga) almost at the same time with Bemba, Bisa, Lala. During this long journey, the Nsenga people had an intimate encounter with the Bemba people. Under the instruction of their leader Chitimukulu, the Bemba fighters ambushed a beautiful Nsenga woman (Lumbwe) whom Chitimukulu took as one of his wives upon capture. In retaliation, the Nsenga hunters were also ordered by heads of family clans (Tumvi) to hunt down Bemba women. At the time the Nsenga people had no Chiefs but organised under clan system of governance such as ""enetembo, enemwanza, eneng'oma, enelungu, enemumba, enemvula"" headed by Tumvi. It was this hide and seek tribal game, captivity of Bemba and Nsenga women that produced some similarities. Today, we have, for instance, some Bemba names such as Nkonde, Mwape, Ngosa (Nsenga call Ngoza), Lumbwe among the Nsenga people. While the Bembas will greet their visitors ""mulishani"", the Nsenngas will do the same by saying ""mulityani). These are some of the many dialect similarities between the two tribes.

Two players scoop four rows of holes in the ground and begin to play, usually with the help of a number of bystanders. However, carved wooden game boards exist from earlier years and can also still be bought at tourist markets in [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]] and [[Lusaka]]. Several variations of the game exist.

Paramount Chief Mpezeni,"{{Short description|Ngoni king}}
'''Inyandezulu Inkosi Yamakhosi Mphezeni KaZwangendaba''' is the King of the [[Ngoni people]] of Eastern Province, East Africa and [[Malawi]]'s Mchinji district.  

== Family ==
He is from the lineage of Prince Jele KaMfeka of the Ncwangeni Nguni family. His mother was Queen Soseya Nxumalo of the Ndwandwe royal house. Both his mother and her elder sister, Queen Loziwawa, were nieces of King [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]]. 

His birthright title is Inkosi Yamakhosi<ref>{{Cite web |title=Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/100069314013786/posts/pfbid0621N9YtV7j9hzkQ4b3ZvjADToP4KKby4a6ExhxEkySJHTbzkdgedBpfkr8BrLg5al/?app=fbl |access-date=2024-01-16 |website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> or Inyandezulu. The title of 'Paramount Chief' was introduced on the Ngoni Nation after 1898 following the defeat of the Ngonis in their war with the British. King Njengambaso KaPontino has been the monarch of the Mphezeni. He is a great great grandson of the first Mphezeni since 1981. His mother was Ndlunkulu Tilekane from the Nzima clan. She came from Nyalongo village in the area of iNkosi Maguya. 

Inyandezulu Inkosi Yamakhosi Mphezeni KaZwangendaba has Amakhosi who serve under him. These are grouped according to Izigodi (in Zambia they use the term 'Chibaya').

=== Title controversy ===
Prince Gumbi Kaziguda Jele argued that this title is foreign and demeaning as compared to Inkosi Yamakhosi or King. 

Most awakened Ngonis have rejected the title 'Paramount Chief', noting that foreign laws cannot supersede Ngoni customs and laws. More and more Ngonis are calling on the Zambian Government to replace it with Inkosi Yamakhosi. 

==Dynasty==
The Kingdom was founded by King uJzwangendaba KaHlwatshwayo, leader of the Jele clan of the Hluhluwe area in South Africa. King Zwangendaba was born in the St. Lucia Bay area in 1777. His mother was from the Nzima clan. He took over as the King of the Jeles when he was aged 35.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |title=THE BEGINNING OF A NGUNI STORY THAT SHAPED SOUTHERN, CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICAN KINGDOMS. |url=https://nthawi.blogspot.com/2022/04/ancient-nguni-of-ncwangeni-kingdoms.html |access-date=2024-01-15 |website=THE BEGINNING OF A NGUNI STORY THAT SHAPED SOUTHERN, CENTRAL AND EAST AFRICAN KINGDOMS.}}</ref> 

He first married Ndwandwe Princesses Loziwawa and Soseya whom he placed in his village of Ekuveleleni (also Emveyweyeni). Ekuveleleni means 'a place of prominence'. He later married another 65+ wives and fathered more than 200 children.<ref name="":0"" /> King uZwangendaba was from a different Nguni group. His father was King Hlatshwayo, who reigned from eLangeni royal village in the North of Zulu Land. King Hlatshwayo was a son of King Magaganta. Their lineage is from King Mcwango of the Ncwangeni umbrella.<ref name="":0"" /> 

When the Ncwangeni settled on this coastal land, the Mkhwanazi, [[Mthethwa Clan|Mthethwa]], Msweli and Mcambi clans had not yet arrived and other Ncwangeni clans such as the Phakathi, Mzimela and Msane among others had not yet emerged. King Mfekaye instructed his first son in iKhohlo (Junior house) Prince Jele kaMfekaye to establish himself in the St Lucia area and lead the Ncwangeni section in that part of the Kingdom. Those people became known as abakwaJele, the people of Jele.<ref name="":0"" /> King Jele kaMfeka (also Nkabaluthuli) begot King Nguboyengwe who begot King Dlomo who begot King Nonyanda who begot King Mangangatha who begot King Hlatshwayo who begot King Zwangendaba and King Somkhanda. King Zwangendaba led an exodus that established the BaNgoni Kingdoms in Zambia and Malawi, with King Somkhanda (Gumbi) returning to the Mkhuze area to establish the Gumbi kingdom.<ref name="":0"" /> 

The group is named for Ngoni warrior-king Mphezeni (also Mpeseni). That kind gathered over 4000 warriors in 1897 to attack the [[British Empire|British]] who were taking control of Nyasaland and North-Eastern Rhodesia, and was defeated. He signed a treaty that allowed him to rule as Paramount Chief.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=T W |last=Baxter|title=The Angoni Rebellion and Mpeseni |url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V1N2/V1N2.htm |access-date=29 April 2007 |journal=The Northern Rhodesia Journal |volume= I|issue= 2 |pp=14-24|year=1950}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=NGONI CHIEFTAINCY|url=https://www.facebook.com/The-Awakening-of-the-Angoni-106110267979934|website=The Awakening of the Angoni}}</ref>

'''Samp''' is a food made from dried [[corn kernel]]s that have been pounded and chopped until broken, but not as finely ground as [[mealie-meal]] or mielie rice. The coating around the kernel loosens and is removed during the pounding and stamping process. It is eaten across South Africa and by the [[Lozi people|Lozi]] and Tonga people of [[Zambia]] with sugar and sour milk.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Toi|first1=Cheryl Sam|last2=Cleaton-Jones|first2=Peter|date=April 2006|title=The effect of traditional African food mixtures on growth, pH and extracellular polysaccharide production by mutans streptococci in vitro|journal=Anaerobe|volume=12|issue=2|pages=99–105|doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2006.01.001|pmid=16701622|issn=1075-9964}}</ref> It can also be served with gravy and various additives. It is cooked with beans in the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] variant of [[umngqusho]] and sometimes eaten with [[chakalaka]]. It can also be served with [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[poultry]] and in stuffings.

""Samp"" is of Native American origin, coming from the Narragansett word ""nasàump.""<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Stavely|first1=Keith|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MVLqCQAAQBAJ&q=nas%C3%A0ump.&pg=PA22|title=America's Founding Food: The Story of New England Cooking|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=Kathleen|date=2006-03-08|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-7672-5|pages=22|language=en|chapter=Corn {{!}} ''Samp and Hominy''|quote=[[Roger Williams]] [...] was an open-minded and acute observer of the native way of life, [...] In his account of the Narragansett group with which he was most familiar, written in the 1640s, Williams referred to a corn preparation called “'''Nasàump'''"" [...“...] From this the English call their '''samp''', which is the '''Indian corn''', beaten and boiled, and eaten hot or cold with milk or butter, which are mercies beyond the natives’ plain water, and which is a dish exceedingly wholesome for the English bodies.”}}</ref> New Englanders since early colonial times have referred to cornmeal mush or cereal as ""samp.""

Like [[hominy]], samp is prepared from [[groats]] (dehulled kernels) of [[maize]], but the two are produced by different processes.

Unbroken and unhusked maize (corn) kernels can also be cooked (boiled) until tender. This food is called ""[[:af:stampmielies|stampmielies]]"" in Afrikaans. Samp is often served with beans, as in ""samp and beans"".

'''South Africa – Zambia relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between [[South Africa]] and [[Zambia]]. Both countries are members of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) and [[African Union]].

==Historical relations==
{{More citations needed|section|small=y|date=March 2025}}

=== Pre-Apartheid ===
South Africa and [[Northern Rhodesia]] (Zambia) were part of the [[British Empire]] and shared common characteristics, including the settlement of Europeans and the dispossession of native Black Africans. The area brought into the Empire by the [[British South Africa Company]] led by [[Cecil Rhodes]].

=== Apartheid-era ===
Zambia became independent in 1964 and, under President [[Kenneth Kaunda]], the country actively supported the [[African National Congress]] and the [[SWAPO|South West Africa People's Organization]], which fought the [[Namibian War of Independence]] against South African occupation in [[Namibia]].<ref>[http://disa.nu.ac.za/index.php?option=com_displaydc&recordID=the19921100.012.000 Zambia, the ANC and the struggle against apartheid 1964-1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174854/http://disa.nu.ac.za/index.php?option=com_displaydc&recordID=the19921100.012.000 |date=2011-06-29 }} by Mzamo Wilson Jacobs, [[Rand Afrikaans University]], 1992</ref> In 1990, the ANC expressed ""sincere gratitude to [Zambia] for their selfless support and involvement with us in the struggle..."".<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/7133 Statement of the extended meeting of the National Executive Committee of the African National Congress]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ANC.org.za, 21 January 1990</ref>

=== Post-apartheid ===
In the early 2000s, South African company [[Sun International]] invested [[US$]] 56 million in Zambia to create the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110104045303/http://www.sun-city-south-africa.com/sun-international-hotels/zambezi-sun.asp Zambezi Sun Hotel]. In 2009, nearly 52% of all imports to Zambia were from South Africa. South Africa was the seventh largest exporter of Zambian goods at approximately 7%.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/zambia/ CIA World Factbook-Zambia]</ref>

== Military relations ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2025}}
During apartheid, Zambia provided refuge and military training bases for South African liberation movements. Today, military cooperation is largely within the framework of [[Southern African Development Community]] peacekeeping initiatives.

== Economic relations ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2025}}
Trade between the two countries is significant, with South African businesses heavily invested in Zambia’s retail, mining, and banking sectors. However, reports highlight concerns over South African mining companies operating in lead-contaminated areas like [[Kabwe]], where pollution remains a severe public health issue.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zambia government's neglect exposing more children to lead poison, HRW says |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/5/zambia-governments-neglect-exposing-more-children-to-lead-poison-hrw-says |access-date=2025-03-11 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

Theatre of Zambia,"{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}

[[Zambia]] is a landlocked country in southern Africa. Modern '''Zambian theatre''' has developed [[syncretism|syncretically]] from the melding of traditional local ritual and ceremonial forms of dance, drama and narrative storytelling, with [[History_of_theatre#European_theatre|Western theatre]] that was introduced during [[History_of_Zambia#Colonial period|the colonial period]]. 

==About==
===Traditional dance and dramatic forms===
Zambia is homeland to seventy-three [[Bantu peoples]], each with [[Bantu languages|their own language]]. Traditional rituals and ceremonies of the region incorporated dance and/or dramatic elements included:
* ''kuombaka'' — a royal seasonal ceremony ([[Lozi people|Lozi]]){{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}
* ''makishi'' — a [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] ([[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Province]]){{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}
* ''ncwala'' — a commemoration of victories ([[Nguni people|Nguni]]) {{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}
* ''nyau kasinja'' — a funeral dance ([[Eastern Province, Zambia|Eastern Province]]){{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}
* ''umutomboko'' — a celebration of the rule of [[Kazembe#Origin of the Luba-Lunda-Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]], which re-enacted the crossing of the [[Luapula River]] ([[Eastern Lunda]]){{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}{{sfn|Kerr|2004|page=272}}

Additionally, there were widespread traditions of [[oral storytelling]], particularly [[fable]]s featuring the [[trickster]] hare Kalulu and other animals, which promoted moral behaviour and satirised human foibles.{{sfn|Chilala|2011|page=26}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|pages=43-44}}{{sfn|Ebewo|2001|page=52}}

===Colonial and post-colonial dance and drama===
Performance of traditional rituals and ceremonies was discouraged by [[History_of_Zambia#Colonial period|European colonisers]] of [[Northern Rhodesia]] and its predecessor territories. The mixing of ethnic traditions due to urbanisation in new copper mining towns, and in some cases a gradual shift from ritual to commercial performance, resulted in new [[syncreticism|syncretic]] dance and dramatic forms.{{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}{{sfn|Diakhate|2013|page=343}}

[[History_of_theatre#European_theatre|Western theatre]] was also introduced. The Northern Rhodesian Drama Association (later the Theatre Association of Zambia, TAZ), a [[racial segregation|whites-only]] organisation, was founded in 1952 and over the next few years several similarly-segregated theatres were constructed. Segregation was overturned in 1958 when the newly-formed multi-racial Waddington Theatre Club were permitted to join the association.{{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}

Radio broadcasting was significant in the development of local drama. The [[Central African Broadcasting Services]] was founded in 1948 by Harry Franklin, a government information officer, and targeted indigenous listeners, with programs not only in English but in a variety of local languages.{{sfn|Kerr|2004|page=282}} Africans trained in radio techniques included [[Andreya Masiye]], author of Zambia's first full-length play; his 1973 ''The Lands of Kazembe'' performed at the Chikwakwa Theatre adapted his 1957 radio play ''Kazembe and the Portuguese''.{{sfn|Banham, et al.|1994|page=129}}{{sfn|Kerr|2004|page=282}}{{sfn|Kerr|2004|page=286}} In addition to formally-written plays, radio also broadcast ongoing improvised plays. For instance, ''[[Malikopo]]'' was a long-running weekly satirical radio drama in [[Tonga_language_(Zambia_and_Zimbabwe)|siTonga]] starring [[Edward Mungoni]]. It began in 1947 and was still popular into the nineteen-eighties.{{sfn|Kerr|2004|page=282}}{{sfn|Gomla|2012|page=43}}It is worth noting however that during the colonial period there was no publication of a stage play written by an indigenous Zambian despite the fact that the Zambian publishing industry was born in 1937 when the colonial Northern Rhodesian government established the African Literature Committee.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Chilala |first1=Cheela |title=An Analysis of Gender Issues in Zambian Literature in English |date=2006 |publisher=University of Zambia |location=Lusaka |degree=MA Lit |page=18 |url=http://dspace.unza.zm/handle/123456789/966 |access-date=3 August 2020}}</ref>

The indigenous Zambian Arts Trust formed in 1963. It toured with a repertoire of plays in Zambian languages and English, and ran theatre festivals.{{sfn|Banham|1995|page=1225}}One of the distinguishing features of the plays written and performed by indigenous Zambians is that they drew inspiration and some materials from the Zambian oral traditions which included performances such as the oral narratives which are associated with traditional forms of dramatic expression. As Chilala argues in his article 'The African Narrative as a Tool of Education' African playwrights, including Zambians, have been known to blend traditional art forms and western dramatic concepts.

UNZADRAMS, the University of Zambia's drama society, was pivotal in the development of Zambian theatre, both as a foundation for future developments and in reaction to it. UNZADRAMS produced Zambian plays, built the open air [[Chikwakwa Theatre]], instituted a touring company, and produced ''The Chikwakwa Review'', a journal.{{sfn|Banham|1995|page=1225}}

In 1975, the black-led Zambian National Theatre Arts Association (ZANTAA) was formed in opposition to TAZ due to dissatisfaction with the attitude of its predominantly white leadership towards non-western theatre. In 1986, [[Kebby Musokotwane]], then Zambia's [[Minister of General Education and Culture, Zambia|Minister of General Education and Culture]], directed that the two organisations be merged to form the National Theatre Arts Association of Zambia (NATAAZ).{{sfn|Kerr|1995|pages=110-11}}


===Modern===
An organized Western-styled [[theatre]] movement can be found in [[Lusaka]] and other urban settings,{{fact|date=September 2017}} but traditional dramatic arts are also part of the fabric of traditional life in many rural communities.{{fact|date=September 2017}}  In recent years{{when|date=September 2017}}, drama has been an especially important avenue for the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]] in Zambia.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Tonga baskets,"{{More references|date=December 2009}}

'''Tonga baskets''' or '''Binga baskets''' are baskets woven by the [[Tonga people (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]] women of the [[Southern Province, Zambia|Southern Province]] of [[Zambia]], who are renowned for their [[basket weaving]]. The baskets have a distinctive design with a square bottom forming the foundation of the basket.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Lisa|first1=Cliggett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9sWAgAAQBAJ&q=Tonga+Craft+Centre&pg=PA121|title=Tonga Timeline: Appraising Sixty Years of Multidisciplinary Research in Zambia and Zimbabwe|last2=Virginia|first2=Bond|date=2013-11-11|publisher=The Lembani Trust|isbn=978-9982-9972-7-0|language=en}}</ref>

It takes approximately two weeks to complete a basket about 35 cm in diameter. The baskets are made from the ilala or malala [[Arecaceae|palm]] (''mapokwe'' in Tonga), which, although growing freely, is also planted by Tonga women for the purpose of basket making.  This re-planting became standard practice in the late 1980s with the opening of the Tonga Craft Centre in [[Binga village]], [[Zimbabwe]] a centre funded by the [[Government of Denmark|Danish government]], which exported thousands of baskets a year. This craft centre was meant to keep the traditional crafts alive: basket-making, [[drum]] making, [[carving]], [[pottery]], and [[Beadwork|beading]]. The Tonga live in an area prone to drought and poverty, and the basket making helped the women feed their families.

Traditionally, the baskets are used for carrying [[maize]] or [[sorghum]] from the fields and then winnowing the grain. Traditional designs includes stripes, a spider web type pattern and a lightning pattern. Some Tonga, typically women, partake in basket weaving as a source of income.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Manyena |first=Siambabala Bernard |last2=Fordham |first2=Maureen |last3=Collins |first3=Andrew |date=2008 |title=Disaster Resilience and Children: Managing Food Security in Zimbabwe's Binga District |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7721/chilyoutenvi.18.1.0303 |journal=Children, Youth and Environments |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=15 |doi=10.7721/chilyoutenvi.18.1.0303?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |issn=1546-2250}}</ref>

The '''United Party''' was a political party in [[Zambia]].

==History==
The party was established in mid-1966 by two [[Lozi language|Lozi]]-speaking MPs, one from the [[United National Independence Party]] ([[Dickson Chikulo]]) and one from the [[Zambian African National Congress]] ([[Mufaya Mumbuna]]).<ref>William Tordoff (1974) ''Politics in Zambia'', University of California Press, p22</ref> It was originally named the '''United Front''' before becoming the United Party.<ref>Miles Larmer (2013) ''Rethinking African Politics: A History of Opposition in Zambia'', Ashgate Publishing, p139</ref> The founders were later joined by other prominent political figures, including former minister [[Nalumino Mundia]], who became its president. The defections resulted in by-elections being called, with only Chikulo standing for re-election (and losing).<ref>Tordoff, p205</ref>

The party grew rapidly, but was banned in August 1968 after the government blamed it for violence.<ref>Tordoff, p156</ref> It subsequently merged into the ZANC.<ref>Tordoff, p306</ref>

{{Politics of Zambia}}

The '''United Progressive Party''' (UPP) was a political party in [[Zambia]]. The current president of the party is Saviour Chishimba.

==History==
The party was established by [[Simon Kapwepwe]] and several others who had left the ruling [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) in August 1971.<ref>Jan-Bart Gewald, Marja Hinfelaar & Giacomo Macola (2008) ''One Zambia, Many Histories: Towards a History of Post-colonial Zambia'', BRILL, p98</ref>

On 21 December of the same year Kapwepwe, taking advantage of a [[by-election]], became an MP for the UPP. Kaunda reacted swiftly; on 4 February 1972, he made the specious accusation that Kapwepwe was an instrument of the White [[Rhodesia]]n, [[South Africa]]n and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] governments; Kapwepwe and 122 of his followers were arrested and the UPP was banned. Before the end of the year a [[one-party state]] was proclaimed, and Kaunda felt sure enough of his power to free Kapwepwe on 31 December. Kapwepwe retired from politics and only appeared briefly in 1978, when he and [[Harry Nkumbula]] stood for Zambia's one-party presidential nomination against Kaunda. Both Nkumbula and Kapwepwe were outmaneuvered by Kaunda, who secured the nomination while the two of them disappeared from Zambia's political scene.

The '''vice president of Zambia''' is the second highest position in the [[executive branch]] of the [[Zambia|Republic of Zambia]]. The vice president was previously appointed by the [[President of Zambia|president]] before the amendment of the [[Constitution of Zambia|Constitution]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/zambian-vice-president-sacked-over-drc-row-223291|title=Zambian vice-president sacked over DRC row &#124; IOL News|website=www.iol.co.za}}</ref> Under the amended Constitution, when the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president automatically assumes the presidency, unlike when the Constitution demanded holding of presidential by-election within 90 days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/zambia-gets-white-vice-president|title=The Voice|access-date=15 May 2012|archive-date=9 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109074846/http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/zambia-gets-white-vice-president|url-status=dead}}</ref> This is so because now every presidential candidate shall pick a vice presidential running mate and the two will share the vote meaning voting for a president is an automatic vote for the vice president.

The vice president also heads the [[Office of the Vice-President (Zambia)|Office of the Vice President]], a government ministry, and is also automatically a member of the [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]].

[[Rupiah Banda]] became acting president on 19 August 2008 following the death of President [[Levy Mwanawasa]], while [[Guy Scott]] became acting president 28 October 2014 following the death of President [[Michael Sata]]. Banda was elected president in the subsequent election, and Scott did not stand.

'''White people in Zambia''' or '''White Zambians''' are people from [[Zambia]] who are of [[White Africans of European ancestry|European descent]] and who do not regard themselves, or are not regarded as, being part of another [[Race (classification of humans)|racial group]]. Many are of [[British people|British]] ancestry and are descendants of people who worked in the [[Copperbelt Province]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4etLAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA34|title= The African Christian Diaspora: New Currents and Emerging Trends in World Christianity|isbn= 978-1-4411-3667-1|last1= Adogame|first1= Afe|date= 4 April 2013|publisher= A&C Black}}</ref> 

==Background==
The first Europeans to discover Zambia were the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the late 1700s.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WD-MDwAAQBAJ&dq=first+europeans+to+discover+zambia+portuguese&pg=PT23 | title=A Guide to Agribusiness in Zambia.: Untapped Opportunities | isbn=9781796019025 | last1=Tembo | first1=Felix | date=6 March 2019 | publisher=Xlibris Corporation }}</ref>

In the 1960s, White Zambians tended to favour white-minority rule in [[Rhodesia]] and the [[apartheid]] system in [[South Africa]], although small numbers prevented them from establishing a similar form of government in Zambia. At the Copperbelt mines, 6,500 expatriate workers held South African citizenship. White Zambians made up the second-largest group of immigrants moving to South Africa by 1967, fearful of the changing political climate in Zambia.<ref name=""zastudy"" /> 

Between 1964 and 1972, white Zambians were disproportionately represented in the officer corps of the [[Zambian Defence Force]].{{sfn|Fischer|Morris-Jones|2012|pp=206-207}} Upon independence, most of the senior officer corps, including the chief of staff of the Zambian Army, were White Zambians.{{sfn|Fischer|Morris-Jones|2012|pp=206-207}} By 1972, sufficient numbers of qualified black Zambian personnel had been trained to replace them, and many of the white senior officers retired.<ref name=""SAPES1994"" /> For a number of years afterwards, white Zambians were explicitly barred from enlisting in the national military and received a blanket exemption from conscription.<ref name=""SAPES1994"" />

In 1966, over half the whites lived on the Copperbelt, 18% lived in [[Lusaka]], and some 95% lived in all near the line of rail from the Copperbelt to the [[Victoria Falls]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JyHtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA355|title= Politics in Zambia|page=355|isbn= 978-0-520-36377-9|last1= Tordoff|first1= William|date= 28 May 2021|publisher= Univ of California Press}}</ref>

==Modern day==
In 2014, Zambia had a White population of European origin which numbered approximately 40,000.<ref name=""Ahmed2014"" /> Since independence, the community has never exceeded 1.1% of Zambia's population. Many long-term residents had voluntarily retained South African or British nationality. However, only about 40,000 hold Zambian citizenship. [[Guy Scott]], a White Zambian citizen and former Vice President, became Acting [[President of Zambia]] after the unexpected death of President [[Michael Sata]].<ref>[https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/29/world/africa/zambia-white-president/index.html Zambia's Guy Scott makes history as white president in sub-Saharan Africa] CNN. 29 October 2014</ref> This made him the first head of state [[White Africans of European ancestry|of European White descent]] in Africa since [[F. W. de Klerk]] in 1989, and the first-ever under a democratically elected government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1029/655604-zambia/|title=Scott named first white African leader since 1994}}</ref>

Zambia Alliance for Progress,"{{Politics of Zambia}}

The '''Zambia Alliance for Progress''' (ZAP) was a political party in [[Zambia]].

==History==
The ZAP was formed in 1999 as a merger of six parties;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/335439.stm ZAP: new party for Zambia ] BBC News, 4 May 1999</ref> including the [[Agenda for Zambia]] (AZ), the Labour Party, the Lima Party, the [[National Citizens' Coalition|National Christian Coalition]] (NCC), the [[National Party (Zambia)|National Party]] (NP) and the [[Zambia Democratic Congress]] (ZDC), as well as the National Pressure Group NGO,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222211013/https://business.highbeam.com/3548/article-1G1-55269336/zambia-alliance-progress-stillborn-baby Zambia Alliance for Progress a still-born baby] Times of Zambia, 26 July 1999</ref> and was headed by ZDC leader [[Dean Mungomba]].

In 2001 it merged into the [[Zambia Republican Party]] (ZRP).<ref>[https://eisa.org.za/wep/zamparties6.htm Zambia: Defunct parties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222143800/https://eisa.org.za/wep/zamparties6.htm |date=2015-12-22 }} EISA</ref> However, after disagreements between Mungomba and [[Benjamin Mwila]], the ZAP left the ZRP and re-registered in order to contest the [[Zambian general election, 2001|2001 National Assembly elections]],<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200106110288.html Zambia: Dissolved Zap Re-Registered] All Africa, 11 June 2001</ref> but failed to win a seat.

The '''''Zambia Daily Mail''''' is an English-language daily [[broadsheet]] [[newspaper]] published in [[Zambia]]. It is one of two [[State media|state-owned]] papers of the [[Government of Zambia|Zambian government]].

==History and operations==
The newspaper arose from the '''''Central African Mail''''', which was bought by the government from David Astor in 1965. It was renamed the '''''Zambian Mail''''' and subsequently the ''Zambia Daily Mail'' in 1970. The paper soon became a mouthpiece for the government, publishing official statements and press releases, while being instructed to become an ""instrument in nation building"". However, this saw a decline in [[wikt:readership|readership]] and [[advertising]].<ref>Bourgault, Louise Manon (1995). ''Mass Media in Sub-Saharan Africa''. [[Indiana University Press]]. p. 162.</ref>

In 2005, its circulation figures were estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000.<ref>de Burgh, Hugo (2005). ''Making Journalists: Diverse Models, Global Issues''. [[Routledge]]. p. 166.</ref>

Zambia–Zimbabwe relations,"{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}
{{Infobox bilateral relations|Zambia–Zimbabwe|Zambia|Zimbabwe}}

'''Zambia–Zimbabwe relations''' are bilateral relations between [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], two neighbouring states in [[Southern Africa]]. Both countries are members of the [[Southern African Development Community]] and the [[African Union]].

From 1953 to 1963 they were, along with Nyasaland (now [[Malawi]]) part of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]].<ref>Africa Today [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9384404_ITM Friends, neighbors, and former enemies: the evolution of Zambia-Zimbabwe relations in a changing regional context.(Southern Africa in the Postapartheid Era)] by Scarritt, James R. ; Nkiwane, Solomon M.; published 01-JAN-96</ref>

Initially the two countries had good relations after gaining [[independence]]. However, relations became strained in 2008 as [[Zambia]], like [[Botswana]], reported similar 'smear campaigns' against the Zambian government by Zimbabwe's state owned media, claiming it was ""hired by Britain to press for a speedy regime change in Harare."" The foreign affairs minister, [[Kabinga Pande]], said it had lodged a protest against [[Zimbabwe]], against the ""sustained malicious campaign against [[Zambia]].""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zimbabwemetro.com/2008/06/05/zambia-protests-against-zimbabwe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610002738/http://zimbabwemetro.com/2008/06/05/zambia-protests-against-zimbabwe/|date=2008-06-05|archive-date=2008-06-10|publisher=Zimbabwe Metro|title=Zambia protests against Zimbabwe}}</ref>

Following the controversial [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|Zimbabwean presidential election of 2008]], Zambian President [[Levy Mwanawasa]] described [[Robert Mugabe]]'s Zimbabwe as a ""regional embarrassment"".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2008/zimbabwe/default.stm ""Zimbabwe's neighbours""], BBC, June 2008</ref> Post-2008, tensions thawed with [[Michael Sata]] affectionately referring to Mugabe as ""Sekuru"" in 2013 at a [[UNWTO]] event hosted in [[Victoria Falls]].

Zambian African National Congress,"{{Short description|Zambian political party}}
The ''' Northern Rhodesia Congress ''' was a [[political party]] in [[Zambia]].

==History==
In 1940, as the '''Northern Rhodesia Congress''' ('''NRC'''), also known as the '''Northern Rhodesia African Congress''' ('''NRAC'''), was formed. [[Godwin Lewanika]], a [[Barotseland]] native from an [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] background, became the first president.<ref>""Northern Rhodesia"", Northern-rhodesia.co.tv, 2011, web:
   [http://northern-rhodesia.co.tv/ NR-1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065228/http://northern-rhodesia.co.tv/ |date=2016-03-07 }}.</ref><ref name=""EB"">
   ""Northern Rhodesia Congress"", Britannica.com, 2011, web:
   [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419866/Northern-Rhodesia-Congress EB-NRC].
</ref> It was the first African political party in the country. NRC had its roots in the [[Federation of Welfare Societies]], active between 1940 and 1946.<ref name=EB/> In 1951 the party adopted the name '''Northern Rhodesian African National Congress''' ('''NRANC''') under the presidency of [[Harry Nkumbula]], and was linked to the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]]. In 1953 [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the general secretary of the organization.

The NRANC was the leading force of Northern Rhodesian nationalism in the 1950s. It opposed federation, and boycotted shops where the [[Colour Bar]] was implemented. In 1955 Nkumbula was imprisoned for possessing banned literature. In 1957 he visited London, gaining some support from the [[British Labour Party]].<ref name=HDZ>{{cite book|editor-first=David J.|editor-last=Simon|editor2-first=James R.|editor2-last=Pletcher|editor3-first=Brian V.|editor3-last=Siegel|title=Historical Dictionary of Zambia|series=African Historical Dictionaries|volume=106|location=Metuchen, New Jersey|publisher=Scarecrow Press|edition=3rd|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8108-5305-8|contribution=African National Congress (ANC)|pages=6–7}}</ref>

In 1958 the party was divided on whether to participate in the [[1959 Northern Rhodesian general election]], in which only a minority of the black population was allowed to vote. The more [[Radicalization|radical]] Kaunda broke away, and formed the [[Zambian African National Congress (1958–59)|Zambia African National Congress]], which was banned in 1959. The NRANC won a single seat in the elections. In the [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1962|1962 general elections]] the party won seven seats, becoming the third-largest faction in the Legislative Assembly and held the balance of power. Prior to the elections Nkumbula had made a secret electoral pact with the [[United Federal Party]], but decided to form a government with the [[United National Independence Party]].

The party won ten seats in the [[Northern Rhodesian general election, 1964|1964 general elections]], and following independence, was renamed the Zambian African National Congress. Nkumbula ran for president in the [[Zambian general election, 1968|1968 general elections]], finishing second to Kaunda with 18% of the vote. The party won 23 of the 110 seats in the [[National Assembly (Zambia)|National Assembly]], remaining the main [[Parliamentary opposition|opposition party.]]

In 1973 the party was banned,<ref>[https://eisa.org.za/wep/zamparties6.htm Zambia: Defunct parties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222143800/https://eisa.org.za/wep/zamparties6.htm |date=2015-12-22 }} EISA</ref> as the country became a one-party state.

The '''''Zambian Watchdog''''' is an investigative online media platform that focuses on [[corruption]] and other major crimes such as [[drug trafficking]] in [[Zambia]]. It also contains breaking news on politics and major events in Zambia. The ''Zambian Watchdog'' was founded as a newspaper with an online edition, but was forced into [[exile]] in 2009 and subsequently closed its printed newspaper.

Journalists for the newspaper operate [[undercover]] and anonymously in Zambia, but the editors lived in exile due to [[Death threat|threats on their lives]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fojo.se/international/freedom-of-expression-around-the-world/lloyd-from-zambia2 |title=Lloyd from Zambia2 |website=www.fojo.se |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827011236/http://www.fojo.se/international/freedom-of-expression-around-the-world/lloyd-from-zambia2 |archive-date=2010-08-27}} </ref>

Its official site and multiple linking pages to the posts have been censored inside Zambia by the government, restricting the human right of [[freedom of speech]]. After the controversial 2016 presidential elections, the ''Zambian Watchdog'' Facebook page was blocked by Facebook, citing its rules similar to the ones used to block Donald Trump's page.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This was done after claims by the government that the ''Watchdog'' was inciting violence in the country through false and unprofessional reports, particularly claiming it supported the opposition [[UPND]].

Journalists writing for the ''Zambian Watchdog'' frequently face state-sponsored persecution. Some are currently attending court trials on what human rights bodies and local media associations claim are trumped up charges in a move perceived as state retribution.

'''ZESCO''' (acronym for '''Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited''') is a [[state-owned]] power company in [[Zambia]]. It is Zambia's largest power company producing about 80% of the electricity consumed in the country.  ZESCO represents Zambia in the [[Southern African Power Pool]].

== History ==
ZESCO was formed as Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited by [[National Assembly of Zambia|parliament]] in December 1969. It took over responsibilities from several municipalities and the three existing utilities: Victoria Falls Power Board, Central Electricity Corporation, and Northern Electricity Supply Corporation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Makai |first=Eugene |date=2024-08-26 |title=SNAPSHOT IN HISTORY – ZESCO, ITS HISTORY AND THE CURRENT POWER SITUATION |url=https://zambianobserver.com/snapshot-in-history-zesco-its-history-and-the-current-power-situation/ |access-date=2025-03-10 |website=The Zambian Observer |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Operations==
The company operates nine [[hydropower|hydropower stations]] with a potential combined capacity of 2,217.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] and eight small [[thermal power|thermal power plants]] with a combined potential capacity of 11.3 MW resulting in a total of 2,228.8 MW. Due to poor maintenance and substandard practices, these capacities are not achieved.<ref>{{cite report |title=Energy Sector Report 2014 |publisher=Energy Regulation Board, Zambia |date=2015 |url=http://www.erb.org.zm/reports/EnergySectorReport2014.pdf}}</ref>

The company also owns and operates power distribution and transmission lines of 9,975 km.

ZESCO has formed power purchase agreements with private companies that own power plants in [[Zambia]]. It purchases the power produced and feeds part of it into the national grid, with a larger portion resold to neighboring countries. GL Africa Energy provides the national grid through ZESCO with over 105 MW of power under this agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201604291134.html|title=Zambia: Ndola Energy Project to Expand|last=Kangali|first=Chatula|date=2016-04-29|work=The Times of Zambia (Ndola)|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref>

ZESCO owns 40% shares in EL Sewedy Electric Zambia Limited.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=27 April 2022 |title=zesco-receives-2m-dividend-from-el-sewedy-electric |url=https://zambiadispatch.com/economy/zesco-receives-2m-dividend-from-el-sewedy-electric/ |access-date=28 April 2022 |website=zambiadispatch.com }}{{Dead link|date=August 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In June 2022, ZESCO signed a 13-year Bulk Supply Agreement (BSA) with [[Copperbelt Energy Corporation]] (CEC) Plc. The power supply limit under the BSA was set at 380MW. ZESCO projects that they will earn an estimated US$150.0 million per annum from the agreement. These earnings are expected to translate into an estimated US$2.0 billion over the lifetime of the BSA.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=11 July 2022 |title=zesco-to-earn-2bn-from-cec-deal |url=http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/zesco-to-earn-2bn-from-cec-deal/ |url-status=dead |access-date=13 July 2022 |website=daily-mail.co.zm |archive-date=13 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713143715/http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/zesco-to-earn-2bn-from-cec-deal/ }}</ref>

In July 2022, at the 94th [https://acsz.co.zm/ Agricultural and Commercial Show] in Lusaka, the managing director of the National Utility ZESCO, Victor Mapani announced that the company plans to deploy [[Electric vehicle|Electric Vehicle]] [[EV charging|(EV) charging]] stations across the country in an effort to accelerate and promote the transition to EVs and enhance carbon emission reduction.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kalonda |first=Fanny |date=30 July 2022 |title=zesco-to-deploy-ev-charging-stations-in-many-towns-mapani |url=https://zambianobserver.com/zesco-to-deploy-ev-charging-stations-in-many-towns-mapani/ |access-date=31 July 2022 |website=zambianobserver.com}}</ref> However, as of February 2025, no significant progress has been reported toward fulfilling this commitment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2025}}

In November 2024, nation-wide [[Power outage|blackouts]] occurred.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mwarumbwa |first=Danai |date=2024-11-28 |title=More power setbacks for Zambia, Zimbabwe |url=https://www.cajnewsafrica.com/2024/11/28/more-power-setbacks-for-zambia-zimbabwe/ |access-date=2025-01-09 |website=CAJ News Africa |language=en-US}}</ref> Although the power was restored the next day, ZESCO struggled to keep up with the electricity demands in Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].

In 2024, ZESCO reported losses of K5.1 million from infrastructure vandalism and K7.46 million in property damage in December alone.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ZESCO Reports K5.1 Million Loss Due to Infrastructure Vandalism |url=https://www.zambiamonitor.com/zesco-reports-k5-1-million-loss-due-to-infrastructure-vandalism/ |access-date=2025-08-11}}</ref> The country also faced prolonged load-shedding, initially promising seven hours of daily power supply, which was later reduced to five hours by mid-2025 due to the shutdown of a Maamba generator.<ref>{{Cite news |title=ZESCO increases load-shedding after Maamba generator shutdown |url=https://diggers.news/local/2025/06/25/zesco-increases-load-shedding-by-2-hours-after-shut-down-of-maamba-generator/ |access-date=2025-08-11}}</ref> To address power shortages, ZESCO commissioned the 100 MW Chisamba Solar Power Plant in June 2025 and signed PPAs totaling 332 MWp with independent producers for completion by 2026.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ZESCO signs 332 MWp solar PPAs |url=https://zesco.co.zm/zesco_signs_ppas.php |access-date=2025-08-11}}</ref>

==Limitations==
The national grid in Zambia only extends to some parts of the country.  For example, it ends {{convert|380|km|mi}} from the Ikelenge area around [[Kalene Hill]] in the extreme northwest, and as of 2008, ZESCO had no plans to provide power to this remote area due to an increase in shareholder allotments. In response, some small-scale private operations have been established such as the [[Zengamina]] 700&nbsp;KW hydroelectric generator.<ref name=NWZDT>{{cite web
