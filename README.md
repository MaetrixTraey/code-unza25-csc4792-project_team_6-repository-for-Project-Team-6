# Phase 1: Business Understanding

---


## Problem Statement
The English Wikipedia article for Zambia lacks several standard sections found in well-developed country pages, such as Infrastructure, Transportation, Environment, detailed Health Care, and expanded Culture. This reduces the completeness and utility of the page. Our project aims to systematically detect these missing or underdeveloped sections through structured, data-driven analysis.

## 1.1 Business Objectives
Our goal is to identify content gaps in the Zambia Wikipedia page to:
- Help Wikipedia editors prioritize content improvements.
- Provide educators and researchers with a quick reference for missing topics.
- Develop a repeatable method for assessing completeness in other country pages.

Success means delivering an evidence-based list of missing or underdeveloped sections, verified against a benchmark set of complete country pages.

**Desired Outcome:**  
A report and visualizations showing completeness scores per page and a ranked list of the most frequently missing sections.

**Business Success Criteria:**
- Stakeholders (editors, researchers) can use the output to prioritize editing efforts.
- Increased representation of Zambia on Wikipedia within 3–6 months after insights are shared.
- More comprehensive pages that enhance public knowledge about Zambia.
