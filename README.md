# Phase 1: Business Understanding

---


## Problem Statement
The English Wikipedia article for Zambia lacks several standard sections found in well-developed country pages, such as Infrastructure, Transportation, Environment, detailed Health Care, and expanded Culture. This reduces the completeness and utility of the page. Our project aims to systematically detect these missing or underdeveloped sections through structured, data-driven analysis.

## 1.1 Business Objectives
Our goal is to identify content gaps in the Zambia Wikipedia page to:
- Help Wikipedia editors prioritize content improvements.
- Provide educators and researchers with a quick reference for missing topics.
- Develop a repeatable method for assessing completeness in other country pages.

Success means delivering an evidence-based list of missing or underdeveloped sections, verified against a benchmark set of complete country pages.

**Desired Outcome:**  
A report and visualizations showing completeness scores per page and a ranked list of the most frequently missing sections.

**Business Success Criteria:**
- Stakeholders (editors, researchers) can use the output to prioritize editing efforts.
- Increased representation of Zambia on Wikipedia within 3–6 months after insights are shared.
- More comprehensive pages that enhance public knowledge about Zambia.

**Stakeholders:**
- Wikipedia editors (especially Zambian contributors)
- Students and researchers
- Educational institutions
- General public

**Desired Outcome:**  
A report and visualizations showing completeness scores per page and a ranked list of the most frequently missing sections.

**Business Success Criteria (Real-world):**
- Stakeholders (editors, researchers) can use the output to prioritize editing efforts.
- Increased representation of Zambia on Wikipedia within 3–6 months after insights are shared.
- More comprehensive pages that enhance public knowledge about Zambia.

1.2 Assess Situation

**Resources:**
- Wikipedia API for content retrieval
- Python environment (Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: `wikipedia-api`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Team members with skills in programming, data processing, and visualization

**Constraints:**
- Analysis is limited to structure, not factual accuracy
- Wikipedia content changes frequently, affecting reproducibility

**Risks:**
- API rate limits or downtime
- Variation in page structures
- Possible mismatch between our template and Wikipedia editorial norms

**Assumptions:**
- Selected standard template reflects an ideal structure for general topic pages
- Wikipedia API will remain stable during the project timeline

## 1.3 Determine Data Mining Goals

**Overall Data Mining Objective:**
Translate the business objective of improving Zambia’s Wikipedia representation into a technical process that measures completeness.

**Specific Data Mining Goals:**
1. Extract section headings from selected Zambia-related Wikipedia pages using the Wikipedia API.
2. Pre-process and normalize section titles for accurate comparison.
3. Compare the extracted structure against a predefined standard section template.
4. Calculate a completeness score for each page.
5. Identify and rank the most frequently missing sections across all pages.

**Data Mining Success Criteria (Technical):**
- 100% accuracy in detecting section presence/absence compared to manual verification for at least 2 sample pages.
- Completeness scores computed without data loss or parsing errors.
- Identification of at least 3 consistently missing sections across all pages.
